<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>Executive Presence: The Missing Link Between Merit and Success</h2><p><p>Are you &#x201c;leadership material?&#x201d; More importantly, do others perceive you to be? Sylvia Ann Hewlett, a noted expert on workplace power and influence, shows you how to identify and embody the Executive Presence (EP) that you need to succeed.</p><p>You can have the experience and qualifications of a leader, but without executive presence, you won't advance. EP is an amalgam of qualities that true leaders exude, a presence that telegraphs you're in charge or deserve to be. Articulating those qualities isn't easy, however.</p><p>Based on a nationwide survey of college graduates working across a range of sectors and occupations, Sylvia Hewlett and the Center for Talent Innovation discovered that EP is a dynamic, cohesive mix of appearance, communication, and gravitas. While these elements are not equal, to have true EP, you must know how to use all of them to your advantage.</p><p>Filled with eye-opening insights, analysis, and practical advice for both men and women, mixed with illustrative examples from executives learning to use the EP, <em>Executive Presence</em> will help you make the leap from working like an executive to feeling like an executive.</p></p><p><p>Do you exude confidence and credibility? Can you command a room? Sylvia Ann Hewlett, one of the world's most influential business thinkers, cracks the code of Executive Presence (EP) for men and women intent on winning the next plum assignment and doing something extraordinary with their lives.</p><p>You might have the qualifications to be considered for your dream job, but you won't get far unless you can signal that you're "leadership material" and that you "have what it takes." Professionals are judged on presence as well as on performance.&nbsp;</p><p>Using a wealth of hard data&#x2014;including a new nationwide survey and dozens of focus groups&#x2014;Hewlett reveals EP to be a dynamic mix of three things: how you act (gravitas), how you speak (communication), and how you look (appearance). She also draws on in-depth interviews with a wide selection of admired leaders to reveal how they embody and deploy key elements of EP.&nbsp;</p><p>This book is immensely practical. Hewlett teases out tactics that can help you raise your game and close the gap between merit and success. She offers the unvarnished advice you won't get from supportive friends and tackles head-on such touchy subjects as too-tight clothing and too-shrill voices. She shows how the standards for EP vary for men, women, multicultural, and LGBT employees, and she shares how to get meaningful feedback from politically correct bosses intent on avoiding the real issues.&nbsp;</p><p>The good news is that EP is eminently teachable. You can learn how to "show teeth" while remaining likable, and you can teach yourself how to dress appropriately while staying true to yourself. You don't have to be born with the voice of James Earl Jones or the looks of Angelina Jolie to hurdle the EP bar. With hard facts and vivid examples, Hewlett shows you how to ace EP and fully realize your unique potential&#x2014;no matter who you are, no matter where you work.</p><p>Sylvia Ann Hewlett is the founding president of the Center for Talent Innovation, a Manhattan-based think tank where she chairs a task force of eighty-two multinational companies focused on fully realizing the new streams of labor in the global marketplace. Her book <em>Forget a Mentor: Find a Sponsor</em> was named one of the ten best business books of 2013 and won the Axiom Book Award.</p></p><h2>Introduction to Formal Logic Teacher Key: Workbook, Quizzes and Tests (Traditional Logic)</h2><p>The Traditional Logic I Teacher Key contains the answers to the exercises in the Traditional Logic I Student Book and the Quizzes &amp; Tests (both sold separately).</p><p></p><h2>Finite Mathematics, 7th Edition</h2><p>Get the background you need for future courses and discover the usefulness of mathematical concepts in analyzing and solving problems with FINITE MATHEMATICS, 7th Edition. The author clearly explains concepts, and the computations demonstrate enough detail to allow you to follow-and learn-steps in the problem-solving process. Hundreds of examples, many based on real-world data, illustrate the practical applications of mathematics. The textbook also includes technology guidelines to help you successfully use graphing calculators and Microsoft Excel to solve selected exercises.</p><p></p><h2>Major Problems in American Urban and Suburban History (Major Problems in American History Series)</h2><p>This volume offers an examination of the nation&#39;s urban development and reflects the city&#39;s pivotal role in the unfolding of American history. The Second Edition has been significantly revised to include more than 75% new content and a greater emphasis on suburbanization and historically marginalized groups. Chapters included in this edition focus on the lower classes and class relations and conditions; the evolution of technology; race relations and redevelopment in the postwar era; and significant changes in urbanization. In order to address the current urban climate, the final chapter focuses on violence and the search for security in a post-September 11th America.</p><p>Howard P. Chudacoff, the George L. Littlefield Professor of American History and Professor of Urban Studies at Brown University, was born in Omaha, Nebraska. He earned his A.B. (1965) and Ph.D. (1969) from the University of Chicago.

Earlier generations of parents sent such children for psychiatric treatment aimed at a cure, but today, many parents agree to call their children new names, allow them to wear whatever clothing they choose, and approach the state to alter the gender designation on their passports and birth certificates.<br><br> Drawing from sociology, philosophy, psychology, and sexuality studies, sociologist Tey Meadow depicts the intricate social processes that shape gender acquisition. Where once atypical gender expression was considered a failure of gender, now it is a form of gender. Engaging and rigorously argued,&nbsp;<i>Trans Kids&nbsp;</i>underscores the centrality of ever more particular configurations of gender in both our physical and psychological lives, and the increasing embeddedness of personal identities in social institutions.</p><br></p><p><p>&#x201c;<i>Trans Kids</i>&nbsp;shows us how stories are social actions&nbsp;and&nbsp;how description can let us understand the lived struggle of trans kids as they find themselves defined within any number of social forms.&nbsp;In this book, new stories make for new knowledge and new forms of care.

Brilliantly and lovingly translated in 1949 by M.F.K. Fisher (herself the doyenne of 20th-century food writing), the book offers the Professor's meditations not just on matters of cooking and eating, but extends to sleep, dreams, exhaustion, and even death (which he defines as the "complete interruption of sensual relations"). Brillat-Savarin, whose genius is in the examination and discussion of food, cooking, and eating, proclaims that "the discovery of a new dish does more for human happiness than the discovery of a star."<p> Chocoholics will be satisfied to know that "carefully prepared chocolate is as healthful a food as it is pleasant ... that it is above all helpful to people who must do a great deal of mental work...." He examines the erotic properties of the truffle ("the truffle is not a positive aphrodisiac; but it can, in certain situations, make women tenderer and men more agreeable"), the financial influence of the turkey (apparently quite a prize in 19th-century Paris), and the level of <i>gourmandise</i> among the various professions (bankers, doctors, writers, and men of faith are all predestined to love food). Just as engrossing as the text itself are M.F.K. Fisher's lively, personal glosses at the end of every chapter, which make up almost a quarter of the book. These two are soulmates separated by centuries, and Fisher's fondness for the Professor comes through on every page. As she notes at the end, "I have yet to be bored or offended, which is more than most women can say of any relationship, either ghostly or corporeal." <i>--Rebecca A.

This witty love story combines a comic portrayal of life in an English cathedral with larger social and political issues.<br><br><em>The Warden</em> is the first of six books which form Trollope's Barsetshire series of novels. The thoroughly revised new edition includes 'The Two Heroines of Plumplington', the short story which Trollope added just before his death to provide a final episode in the annals of Barsetshire.<br><br><strong>ABOUT THE SERIES: </strong>For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the widest range of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, helpful notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more<strong>.</strong><br></p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.The first of Trollope&#39;s popular Barsetshire novels, set in the fictional cathedral town of Barchester, &#34;The Warden centers on the honorable cleric Septimus Harding, one of Trollope&#39;s most memorable characters. When Harding is accused of mismanaging church funds, his predicament lays bare the complexities of the Victorian world and of nineteenth-century provincial life. And, as Louis Auchincloss observes in his Introduction, &#34;The theme of &#34;The Warden presents the kind of social problem that always fascinated Trollope: the inevitable clash of ancient privilege with modern social awareness.&#34;</p><h2>Quantum Field Theory: A Modern Introduction</h2><p>The rise of quantum electrodynamics (QED) made possible a number of excellent textbooks on quantum field theory in the 1960s. However, the rise of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and the Standard Model has made it urgent to have a fully modern textbook for the 1990s and beyond. Building on the foundation of QED, <em>Quantum Field Theory: A Modern Introduction</em> presents a clear and comprehensive discussion of the gauge revolution and the theoretical and experimental evidence which makes the Standard Model the leading theory of subatomic phenomena. The book is divided into three parts: Part I, Fields and Renormalization, lays a solid foundation by presenting canonical quantization, Feynman rules and scattering matrices, and renormalization theory. Part II, Gauge Theory and the Standard Model, focuses on the Standard Model and discusses path integrals, gauge theory, spontaneous symmetry breaking, the renormalization group, and BPHZ quantization. Part III, Non-perturbative Methods and Unification, discusses more advanced methods which now form an essential part of field theory, such as critical phenomena, lattice gauge theory, instantons, supersymmetry, quantum gravity, supergravity, and superstrings.<br></p><p>Michio Kaku is at City College of CUNY."The book provides an excellent, up-to-date account of quantum field theory and the approach to quantum gravity. It is well written and well organized to be used not only by anyone who intends to do research work in this field but also for anyone at the level of an advanced graduate student or<br>beyond who is interested in broadening his/her perspectives on what might be the elements of a 'final theory' in physics." --Hans J. Haubold, United Nations Office for Outer Space<br><br>"Unlike older textbooks that focused on quantum electrodynamics (QED), this text centers on the Standard Model and includes gauge theory. Each chapter concludes with a problem set." --SciTech Book News<br><br>"A massive work covering a grand variety of traditional subjects dealt with in most textbooks on this subject, and has done all of us the favor of including, in addition, a good number of current research topics that are normally dealt with only in conference proceedings or specialized texts<br>of their own. This is a lot of book, especially for the relatively modest price." --International Journal of Quantum Chemistry<br><br>"Kaku discusses a mind-boggling variety of topics. . . valuable references. . .useful." --Physics Today<br><br>"This updated and expanded version of many of the standard QFT texts is refreshingly independent. . .an effective introduction to a breathtakingly wide range of topics, and gives an admirable general ordering and emphasis of life material. . .a fascinating resource for a wealth of information<br>and explanation.

Knowledge of buddha nature reveals and reconciles the paradox of how the mind can be the basis for both the duhkha of samsara (the unpurified mind) and the bliss and fulfillment of nirvana (the purified mind). To illustrate this,<i> Samsara, Nirvana, and Buddha Nature </i>first takes readers through Buddhist thought on the self, the four truths, and their sixteen attributes. It then explains afflictions&#x2014;including how they arise and their antidotes&#x2014;followed by an examination of karma and cyclic existence, and, finally, a deep and thorough elucidation of buddha nature. <i>Samsara, Nirvana, and Buddha Nature </i>shows us how to purify our minds and cultivate awakened qualities.<br> <br> This is the third volume in the Dalai Lama&#x2019;s definitive and comprehensive series on the stages of the Buddhist path, <i>The Library of Wisdom and Compassion.</i> Volume 1,<i> Approaching the Buddhist Path,</i> contains introductory material that sets the context for Buddhist practice. Volume 2, <i>The Foundation of Buddhist Practice, </i>describes the important teachings that help us establish a flourishing Dharma practice. <i>Samsara, Nirvana, and Buddha Nature</i> can be read as the logical next step in this series or enjoyed on its own.</p><p>His Holiness the Dalai Lama is the spiritual leader of the Tibetan people.

In its examination of buddha nature&#x2014;spanning early discussions of the mind's potential in the Pali canon through to the teachings of Dzokchen, the Great Perfection&#x2014;it casts a bright light to dispel the darkness of materialism, which deludedly reduces the mind to a mere epiphenomenon or emergent property of the brain.

The present volume ably advances the project begun in the first two and expands its scope enormously. His Holiness and&nbsp;Ven. Thubten Chodron together set out a comprehensive vision of the nature of of samsara and nirvana, of the Buddhist understanding of the nature of mind, and of the path to liberation grounded in the realization of our&nbsp;buddha? nature. The philosophical analysis is precise and comprehensive. The application to personal practice is insightful, direct, and easy to apply.

In this major new history of battle from the age of Homer through the decline of the Roman empire, J. E.

E. Lendon shows us that the most successful armies were those that made the most effective use of cultural tradition. Ancient combat moved forward by looking backward for inspiration&#x2014;the Greeks, to Homer; the Romans, to the Greeks and to their own heroic past. The best ancient armies recruited soldiers from societies with strong competitive traditions; and the best ancient leaders, from Alexander to Julius Caesar, called upon those traditions to encourage ferocious competition at every rank.<br><br> Ranging from the Battle of Champions between Sparta and Argos in 550 B.C. through Julian&#x2019;s invasion of Persia in A.D. 363, <i>Soldiers and Ghosts </i>brings to life the most decisive military contests of ancient Greece and Rome. Lendon places these battles, and the methods by which they were fought, in a sweeping narrative of ancient military history. On every battlefield, living soldiers fought alongside the ghosts of tradition&#x2014;ghosts that would inspire greatness for almost a millennium before ultimately coming to stifle it.</p></p><p>What set the successful armies of Sparta, Macedon, and Rome apart from those they defeated?

Oreo and Roxy don&#x2019;t get along very well, probably because Oreo is a prissy prima donna who cares only about herself, and Roxy has an inferiority complex. Every other day, Roxy snaps and attacks Oreo in an attempt to end her existence and become the sole recipient of my mother&#x2019;s love. Their death battles sound like a hurricane smashing through the house. I groan and look at the clock that hangs on the wall next to my bed, 9:45 a.m. Too early. Let them kill each other. I fall back asleep to the soothing sounds of Roxy tearing Oreo to shreds.</p> <p>Fun Fact</p> <p>I drool so much overnight that I have considered hiring a lifeguard to watch me while I sleep.</p> <p>Only forty-five minutes pass until I wake up for a second time.

I hear a groan escape his bedroom through his partly opened door. Mom opens it every morning before she and Dad leave for work to make sure he can hear me.

He knows I need him.</p> <p>Andrew groggily enters my bedroom wearing a pair of basketball shorts and no shirt. As per usual, we don&#x2019;t talk much as he helps me get ready. He pulls my blanket off, rolls me onto my back, and after grabbing a pair of shorts from my dresser, gently and meticulously pulls them up my legs and over my butt. The shirt he chose is a little stubborn getting over my left arm, but he gets it on after a few tries and manages not to break any bones.</p> <p>&#x201c;Do you need to pee?&#x201d; he asks.</p> <p>&#x201c;No. I&#x2019;ll wait til later,&#x201d; I say.</p> <p>&#x201c;Good, because I wasn&#x2019;t going to do it, anyway.&#x201d;</p> <p>My little brother leans over the bed and slides his arms under my knees and behind my shoulders, lifting and carrying me to my wheelchair.

He unplugs my phone from the charger and sets it on my lap, walks to the kitchen to pour a cup of coffee, which he leaves on the edge of the dining room table for me, then comes back into my room. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going back to bed. Are you good?&#x201d; he asks. I thank him and drive to the dining room to find the coffee that will inject me with the energy to make it through the day.</p> <p>My laptop is sitting next to the cup of steaming coffee (more like coffee-flavored milk, Andrew made it very sweet). Part of Dad&#x2019;s morning routine&#x2014;after getting me up at 6 a.m. for a shower and putting me back in bed afterward&#x2014;is to open my laptop on the edge of the table so I have something to do when Andrew goes back to sleep. I can&#x2019;t physically type on a keyboard or lift the cup of coffee to my lips, but like all daily tasks, I&#x2019;ve found ways to improvise. I have an app for my iPhone that transforms it into a wireless mouse pad and keyboard (I love you, Apple). Sticking out of my coffee is a superlong bendy straw that I ordered off the Internet. It is long enough so that the straw reaches my mouth when the coffee is sitting on the table. Little adaptations like these are what allow me to thrive.</p> <p>Oreo walks past me toward her food bowl that sits on the kitchen floor. I am slightly disappointed in Roxy. One of these days she will accomplish her mission, and I will sleep beautifully until lunchtime. I open Netflix and put on an episode of <i>Breaking Bad</i> while checking my email and blog. Hundreds of new messages. At this point in my life, the summer of 2012, most of my days start by checking fan mail. Thousands of people from around the world write me to share how my blog has impacted their lives or made them laugh. I am twenty years old, and as my number of followers steadily climbs into the hundreds of thousands, I exist in a constant state of disbelief. The emails will have to wait, though, as will the rest of the work that is starting to pile up for my nonprofit. At that moment I just want to take a break from the insanity and enjoy my coffee while watching Walter White cook crystal meth.</p> <p>An hour later my phone rings. It&#x2019;s Mom calling from work as she does every summer morning to make sure Andrew and I haven&#x2019;t set the house on fire.</p> <p>&#x201c;Is Andrew awake yet?&#x201d; she asks.</p> <p>&#x201c;Yeah, he&#x2019;s on the couch watching <i>The Price Is Right</i>,&#x201d; I lie, not wanting to give her the idea that he&#x2019;s being lazy or irresponsible.</p> <p>&#x201c;Whatcha up to?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Just watching Netflix.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What are you guys gonna do for lunch?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. We&#x2019;re fine.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I know you&#x2019;re fine. I&#x2019;m just checking. Can&#x2019;t your mom be concerned?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yup, we&#x2019;re good.&#x201d; We say goodbye.</p> <p>Andrew comes out of his room shortly after. He collapses onto the couch in our living room, and soon, I hear Drew Carey telling contestants to spin the wheel coming from the television. A few minutes later, Andrew yells, &#x201c;Yo, do you care if Ryan comes over later?&#x201d; I don&#x2019;t. His friends and my friends inhabit our house most days of the summer, but he still always asks to make sure I don&#x2019;t need his help with anything before inviting people over.</p> <p>&#x201c;I just need my teeth brushed, hair combed, face washed, and shoes on,&#x201d; I tell him.</p> <p>&#x201c;Yeah, I guarantee that&#x2019;s not happening,&#x201d; he says. Ten minutes later, he helps me do all four things.</p> <p>Ryan arrives, and Andrew informs me they are going to McDonald&#x2019;s and asks if I want anything. &#x201c;A McDouble and a large sweet tea,&#x201d; I say. Andrew says, &#x201c;Okay. So a cheeseburger and a small sweet tea because you weigh thirty pounds, and I&#x2019;m not wasting money on food you won&#x2019;t eat.&#x201d;</p> <p>Twenty minutes later, Andrew and Ryan come back with the goods. Andrew cuts my cheeseburger into four quarters and grabs me a plastic fork (metal forks are too heavy for me, but a fork is necessary since I can&#x2019;t lift my hands as high as my mouth). We eat and play FIFA and go swimming. A summer day doesn&#x2019;t get much better in my mind. It&#x2019;s relaxing, simple, and nothing happens to remind me of the disease that&#x2019;s slowly destroying every muscle in my body. Just a normal day in the Burcaw household. I say &#x201c;normal&#x201d; but what I really mean is &#x201c;normal for us.&#x201d; Ever since my diagnosis, the idea of normalcy has taken on a very different meaning for my family and me.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Text copyright � 2014 by Shane Burcaw</p></p><h2>Beowulf: An Updated Verse Translation (Perennial Classics)</h2><p><p><strong>The acclaimed verse translation of the timeless epic tale of bravery and battle--the enduring saga of the hero Beowulf and the monster Grendel--the first true masterpiece of English literature.</strong></p><p>"No self-respecting college professor will want his students to be without it....Renditions in modern English haven't taken the poetry of the original very seriously--but what a shock now that someone has!

(Biography)</p><p><p><strong>James L. Haley</strong> is an independent scholar living in Austin, Texas. He is the author of numerous books, including <em>The Buffalo War: The History of the Red River Indian Uprising of 1874 and Apaches: A History and Culture Portrait</em> (OU Press).</p>There is no shortage of good biographies of Houston, and the bicentennial of his birth (1993) created a cottage industry of lives, such as Marshall de Bruhl's Sword of San Jacinto (LJ 2/15/93) and John Hoyt Williams's Sam Houston: A Biography of the Father of Texas (LJ 12/92), both out of print. Haley (Texas: From Frontier to Spindletop) argues that most biographies fail to provide a completely accurate picture of the man and that, despite over 60 biographies, Houston remains a mystery in many ways. Using an amazing array of primary source materials, including many recently discovered Houston papers in scattered collections, Haley explores a more personal angle, looking at what "made Houston tick" by examining topics that were important to Houston himself (e.g., Native American dealings). From his rise and fall in Tennessee politics and through his many roles in Texas, Haley paints a lively picture of a sometimes deeply troubled man. While this is not a definitive biography, it is a refreshing, important look at a weighty yet often overlooked figure in American politics. Ample illustrations and Haley's easy style make the book accessible to lay readers, while his exhaustive research should appeal to academics. Recommended for public and academic libraries.

But no discussion of race is complete without exploring the other side--the ways in which some people or groups actually benefit, deliberately or inadvertently, from racial bias. This is the subject of Paula Rothenberg's groundbreaking anthology, <i>White Privilege.</i><br> <br>The new edition of <i>White Privilege</i> once again challenges readers to explore ideas for using the power and the concept of white privilege to help combat racism in their own lives, and includes key essays and articles by Peggy McIntosh, Richard Dyer, bell hooks, Robert Jensen, Allan G. Johnson, and others. Three additional essays add new levels of complexity to our understanding of the paradoxical nature of white privilege and the politics and economics that lie behind the social construction of whiteness, making this edition an even better choice for educators. Brief, inexpensive, and easily integrated with other texts, this interdisciplinary collection of commonsense, non-rhetorical readings lets educators incorporate discussions of whiteness and white privilege into a variety of disciplines, including sociology, English composition, psychology, social work, women's studies, political science, and American studies.</p><p></p><h2>Green: The History of a Color</h2><p><p>In this beautiful and richly illustrated book, the acclaimed author of <i>Blue</i> and <i>Black </i>presents a fascinating and revealing history of the color green in European societies from prehistoric times to today. Examining the evolving place of green in art, clothes, literature, religion, science, and everyday life, Michel Pastoureau traces how culture has profoundly changed the perception and meaning of the color over millennia&#x2015;and how we misread cultural, social, and art history when we assume that colors have always signified what they do today.</p><p>Filled with entertaining and enlightening anecdotes, <i>Green</i> shows that the color has been ambivalent: a symbol of life, luck, and hope, but also disorder, greed, poison, and the devil. Chemically unstable, green pigments were long difficult to produce and even harder to fix. Not surprisingly, the color has been associated with all that is changeable and fleeting: childhood, love, and money. Only in the Romantic period did green definitively become the color of nature.</p><p>Pastoureau also explains why the color was connected with the Roman emperor Nero, how it became the color of Islam, why Goethe believed it was the color of the middle class, why some nineteenth-century scholars speculated that the ancient Greeks couldn't see green, and how the color was denigrated by Kandinsky and the Bauhaus.</p><p>More broadly, <i>Green </i>demonstrates that the history of the color is, to a large degree, one of dramatic reversal: long absent, ignored, or rejected, green today has become a ubiquitous and soothing presence as the symbol of environmental causes and the mission to save the planet.</p><p>With its striking design and compelling text, <i>Green</i> will delight anyone who is interested in history, culture, art, fashion, or media.</p></p><p><p>Praise for the French edition: "Filled with surprising insights and astonishing details, and as playful and humorous as it is erudite, Michel Pastoureau's <i>Green</i> is an entertaining lesson about the way our visual perceptions are modified by culture. With carefully selected and cleverly captioned illustrations, this beautiful book will appeal to general readers as well as scholars. The writing is simple and effective, making for an easy and entertaining read."<b>--Jean-Baptiste Evette, prize-winning French novelist and translator</b></p><p>Praise for the French edition: "This book is a rare fusion of accessible, entertaining writing and rich humanistic learning. Much of the argument is made through historical anecdotes, and Pastoureau has a knack for finding stories that are both instructive and interesting. <i>Green</i> should appeal to historians, art historians, and other scholars in the humanities, as well as to a broad general audience."<b>--David O'Brien, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign</b></p><b>Michel Pastoureau</b> is a historian and director of studies at the �cole Pratique des Hautes �tudes de la Sorbonne in Paris.

YOUNG PETER A. LOVELL Manchester Materials Science Centre 1990 Preface to the first edition Polymers are a group of materials made up of long covalently-bonded molecules, which include plastics and rubbers. The use of polymeric materials is increasing rapidly year by year and in many applications they are replacing conventional materials such as metals, wood and natural fibres such as cotton and wool. The book is designed principally for undergraduate and postgraduate students of Chemistry, Physics, Materials Science and Engineering who are studying polymers. An increasing number of graduates in these disciplines go on to work in polymer-based industries, often with little grounding in Polymer Science and so the book should also be of use to scientists in industry and research who need to learn about the subject.</p><p><p><strong>Robert J. Young</strong> is a professor of polymer science and technology at the University of Manchester and a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering. He has published extensively and is listed on ISIHighlyCited.com. His research focuses on the relationships between structure and properties in polymers and composites.</p> <p><strong>Peter A. Lovell</strong> is a professor of polymer science at the University of Manchester. His research and publications focus on aspects of emulsion polymerization and related processes, especially in relation to understanding how to control the chemical structure, morphology and properties of the polymers produced. </p><p>The second edition of this book is currently the recommended text for a second year undergraduate lecture course I deliver. In future I will recommend the third edition for both this course and a fourth year (Masters) lecture course on advanced polymer synthesis. Moreover, not only have Young and Lovell produced an excellent text (again) for supporting undergraduate teaching, this book is also a superb entry level text for postgraduates students with limited experience of polymers.<br>&#x2015;<em>Chemistry World</em>, 2012</p></p><h2>Guide to Marine Invertebrates: Alaska to Baja California</h2><p>This is a beautiful full-color field guide describing 253 species of inshore, subtidal marine invertebrates that are commonly observed by biologists, divers and naturalists from the Gulf of Alaska to Central Baja California.

It has two parts. &#39;Representing&#39; deals with the different philosophical accounts of scientific objectivity and the reality of scientific entities. The views of Kuhn, Feyerabend, Lakatos, Putnam, van Fraassen, and others, are all considered. &#39;Intervening&#39; presents the first sustained treatment of experimental science for many years and uses it to give a new direction to debates about realism. Hacking illustrates how experimentation often has a life independent of theory. He argues that although the philosophical problems of scientific realism can not be resolved when put in terms of theory alone, a sound philosophy of experiment provides compelling grounds for a realistic attitude. A great many scientific examples are described in both parts of the book, which also includes lucid expositions of recent high energy physics and a remarkable chapter on the microscope in cell biology.</p><p>A lively and clearly written introduction to the philosophy of natural science, organized around the central theme of scientific realism.Ian Hacking is a retired professor of College de France, Chair of Philosophy and History of Scientific Concepts, and retired University Professor of Philosophy at the University of Toronto.

The book is divided into two parts; part one presents a critical examination of sexual ethics and part two consists of a concise treatise on the art of seduction and lovemaking. The central aim of the book argues that Islam is a sexually enlightened religion which teaches that sensuality should not be devoid of spirituality. The book also argues that the loss of sacred sensuality afflicting modern society can be reclaimed by a revival of the classic erotological tradition. Drawing upon the Qur&#39;an, Hadith and traditional erotological literature, the book follows the style and composition of classic Eastern and Afro-Arab love texts like the Kama Sutra and Jalal ad-Din as-Suyuti&#39;s erotic treatises. A Taste of Honey is a thought-provoking work on a highly sensitive, yet extremely important subject.</p><p>Habeeb Akande is a British born writer and historian of Yoruba descent.

Understanding this overarching biblical theme of God&#x2019;s clearly revealed and sovereign plan is essential not only for believers in Christ to make sense of the chaos in our world but also for the church to know and fulfill its God-ordained role in this era&nbsp;of world history. Are we currently living in God&#x2019;s promised kingdom? Yes, say a plethora of professing evangelicals today. No, say the careful reading of the Bible and the biblical evidence marshaled by Dr. Andy Woods in <em>The Coming Kingdom</em>. The conclusions of this book are based on accurate interpretation of Scripture, which are then insightfully compared and contrasted with the various forms of contemporary evangelical teaching about the kingdom. Are you confused by conflicting views on the kingdom? Do you long for something better than the current conditions you see in our world today? Then read <em>The Coming Kingdom</em>. This book shows convincingly from Scripture that the establishment of God&#x2019;s theocratic kingdom on earth is still future and it will be vastly superior to the conditions we see in our world today. <em>The Coming Kingdom</em> clarifies for readers the biblical truth of God&#x2019;s glorious kingdom, while exalting the coming King and edifying the soul of the reader with its constant appeal to God&#x2019;s Word.</p></p><p>Dr. Andrew M.

Each of us has the ability to communicate with them if we open our minds to their teachings. Belinda Womack was a believer in Angels until the age of 12, when she decided she wanted to become a scientist. Years later, working in a biology lab, she found herself in the presence of the Archangel Gabriel and realized her calling as a spiritual conduit for Angelic healing and support. <br> <br>In this book she shares lessons, practices, and daily guidance from the 12 Archangels to help us listen to and heal our wounded inner child, release our fears, and enact deep subconscious transformation. Each word, transmitted directly from the 12 Archangels, carries their love, so that when read, the love is absorbed into the reader&#x2019;s mind and supports the release of our deepest wounds and fears. The tools and exercises shift your vibration so results are both felt and experienced immediately. Each message awakens your innate spiritual power to rebuild destroyed self-esteem, lifting you higher in vibration and allowing life to be filled with the power of your own divinity. <br> <br>The book includes Angelic guided visualizations on working with Angels to access the healing power of the chakras and to manifest with the creative imagination, as well as specific messages from the 12 Archangels designed for quick access to practical guidance when Angelic support is needed in daily life. As Belinda Womack shows, by opening ourselves to the support of the 12 Archangels, we can move out of the past and into Heaven&#x2019;s abundance, heal our inner wounds, and shift our vibration to one of unconditional love for self, others, Mother Earth, and the Universe.</p><p>Belinda J.

She conducts imagery and dreaming workshops internationally.<b>Using Angelic Guidance in Everyday Life <br></b> <br>Practical Application of the 48 Angel Messages <br> <br><i>The Angel Messages are designed to be a quick reference guide for accessing Angelic guidance. <br> <br>Writing with Angels is a partnership. They send me Their teachings through my intuition (knowing). I then translate the message into language. This task is a back-and-forth process of receiving the teaching using the sensory centers in my creative brain while testing the precision and accuracy of the language with my scientific and rational brain. <br> <br>Perhaps the best way to describe the accuracy required in Angelic communication is to have a musician describe how they tune an instrument. A talented musician must know when a note is being played out of key. My friend Robert is such a musician. When he hears sound that is out of tune, you would think someone ran over his foot with a truck. It is the same way when I communicate with an Angel. If I am not hearing the message correctly and recording it precisely I feel contraction in my body. I cannot breathe, because I am hearing notes being played out of key. <br> <br>It was the mission of the Angels and myself to offer guidance that supports everyday life. The assistance provided in the Messages is practical and effective in shifting our vibration closer to the goal of unconditional love. <br> <br>I invite you to open your creative mind and experience the infinite love, color, and truthful communication of Angels. I am forever grateful to coauthor with Them!</i> <br> <br><b><i>Message 5</i> <br> <br>Coming Home</b> <br> <br>On the days that the analytical mind demands control, the ego self releases with full force the judging, comparing, and wanting torpedoes. These torpedoes are thoughts that explode in your head, demanding that you must know what is going to happen next. <br> <br>Before you take your next breath, your thoughts are racing down Scenario Lane, searching for the right house where you can hide safely and prepare yourself for all the worst that can happen. <br> <br>The ego is the part of your mind that identifies itself as separate from God and Creation. It holds within it your personality and how you see yourself in your outer world. The ego mind has great potential for leading you away from your Center, that intuitive all-knowing space where you feel kindred with the universe. <br> <br>When you are thinking from your Center, your head and heart are connected to your inner voice. This voice of God within you has all the answers to all the questions, and when you obey this voice, you are living your life for your highest joy and good. <br> <br>In truth, your ego was designed to bring you back home to the heart of Spirit. We desire to show you how to integrate your ego self--your beautiful, questioning human personality--with your Center, the home of God within you. As the ego and Center become reunited, you will discover the tremendous power of staying present and in tune with all of the Cosmos. <br> <br><b>Bringing Ego Home</b> <br> <br>Breathe in deeply and exhale slowly. See yourself standing under a brilliant white golden Light. See yourself stretching up to greet the Light, and allow the Light of Divine Love to flow into your head and travel all the way down into your feet. The white golden Light is now pouring in, completely filling you until it overflows out through everypore of your body. It even flows out through the soles of your feet and palms of your hands. <br> <br>Gently, with deep, slow breaths, allow your Self to totally dissolve in the love. Say, &#x201c;I Am home, ego come home with me&#x201d;--again and again until you feel relaxed, clear, and peaceful. <br><b><i> <br>Message 15</i> <br> <br>Facing Your Shadow <br></b> <br>Fear&#x2019;s aspects of negative thinking, low self-worth, and envy are often given credit for destroying what is good and joyous. We are here to show you, fear is your greatest teacher. <br> <br>The shadow self is the blanket of fear&#x2019;s negative energy your Soul agreed to learn from, and eventually transform, while here on Earth. This condensed layer of fear separates the ego from Mother Father God.Your shadow is willing to be dissolved by love as soon as you recognize fear as illusion. <br> <br>Ask to meet your shadow and become its friend. Shadow has many secrets, for really your shadow knows exactly where you are stuck in your inhibitions and insecurities. When you feel brave enough to change and break through your attachments and fears, your shadow will reveal all you need to see about what imprisons your ego self. When the ego knows with thought, emotion, and action it is one with God, you are FREE! <br> <br>Why does shadow want to tell you what you are in the dark about?

He lives in London. <p></p>From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by Michael Dirda It's the sheer energy that astonishes. Charles Dickens (1812-1870) began to publish the monthly chapters of what became "The Pickwick Papers" (1836-37) when he was only in his mid-20s. This was immediately followed by "Oliver Twist" (1837-39), which actually started appearing in magazine form while serialization of "Pickwick" was still going on. Thus the young writer was bringing to a close the greatest picaresque comic novel since "Don Quixote" and almost simultaneously creating the piteous Oliver ("Please, sir, I want some more"), the grotesque Fagin and the murderous Bill Sikes. But then Dickens was the ultimate workaholic multi-tasker. As Michael Slater shows in this magnificent account of "a life defined by writing," Dickens was somehow able to produce one masterpiece after another; oversee major magazines (Bentley's, Household Words, All the Year Round); turn out a steady stream of essays and muckraking journalism; speak at fancy banquets and act in amateur theatricals; write hundreds of letters to friends, business associates and admirers; read and analyze in detail the work of would-be novelists; help organize guilds for writers and homes for wayward girls; support an extended family (parents, 10 children, various in-laws and relatives, a mistress and the mistress's mother); travel to America, Italy, Switzerland and France; co-author plays in which he starred (most famously, "The Frozen Deep," written with Wilkie Collins); and, at the end of his life, present the most famous dramatic readings of all time: When Dickens, dressed in immaculate evening clothes, re-created Bill Sikes's murder of the prostitute Nancy, his prompt-copy famously said, "Terror to the end." Women in the audience fainted dead away and men broke down and openly wept. In English literature, only Shakespeare rivals Dickens's imaginative fecundity. Just start listing some of his characters: the miserly Ebenezer Scrooge, the deluded Miss Havisham, the repulsively unctuous Uriah Heep and, of course, the improvident yet ever upbeat Mr. Micawber, for whom something is bound to turn up. But there are scores of others, from Mr. Pickwick's servant Sam Weller and the arch-hypocrite Pecksniff to the self-sacrificing reprobate Sydney Carton ("It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done") and the almost Shakespearean comic nurse Mrs. Gamp. After encountering them, moreover, does anyone ever forget that model for all government bureaucracies, the Circumlocution Office, or the endless legal case of Jarndyce and Jarndyce or the death of Little Nell, which in its time produced near mass hysteria? Considered as writing alone, Dickens's prose is so rich, varied and untrammeled that James Joyce himself would envy it. The man could take a simple signature phrase for a minor character -- such as "Barkis is willing" or the Fat Boy's "I wants to make your flesh creep" -- and make it simultaneously comic, touching and immortal. He could describe a thick and smothering London fog so powerfully that a Cornell professor named Vladimir Nabokov could spend an entire hour on the author's subtle artistry (and did: see Nabokov's "Lectures on Literature"). Not only a great creative imagination, though, Dickens was also a social crusader, regularly lashing out at human callousness and injustice. In "Bleak House," for instance, the little crossing-sweeper Jo has been given nothing at all by life; indeed, he hears the Lord's Prayer for the first time only as he dies. After which, Dickens lets us have it: "Dead, your Majesty. Dead, my lords and gentlemen. Dead, Right Reverends and Wrong Reverends of every order. Dead, men and women, born with Heavenly compassion in your hearts. And dying thus around us, every day." Charles Dickens himself was born the son of a minor government official who eventually fell on hard times and ended up spending some months in a debtor's prison. During that period, his bookish son was sent out to work among the rough lads of a blacking factory. The mature Dickens kept all this past hidden from his contemporaries, never quite realizing that it had provided him with the best education he could have asked for: During those hardscrabble years, he truly learned about life and about London life, in particular. As Slater reminds us, Dickens always drew enormous energy from just wandering the streets of the monstrous and teeming metropolis. There have been plenty of previous biographies of England's greatest novelist, most notably the early life by his friend John Forster, the once standard scholarly account by Edgar Johnson (in two volumes) and the detailed, idiosyncratic and best-selling "Dickens" by novelist Peter Ackroyd. None of those books is short, nor is this one. Yet Slater's new biography actually feels somewhat austere: Slater sticks to the known Gradgrindian facts, emphasizes the writing and public performances, seldom goes in for much scene-painting or gratuitous anecdote, and refuses to speculate unduly without evidence, whether about Dickens's intimate relations with the young actress Ellen "Nelly" Ternan -- did they have an illegitimate son, as has been frequently suspected? -- or about the resolution of his last, unfinished book, "The Mystery of Edwin Drood." But Slater's calm march through the life and work of "this very strange genius" consequently feels completely trustworthy, as befits a scholar who has been a past president of both the International Dickens Fellowship and the Dickens Society of America. He repeatedly underscores what Dickens called the "strict attention, perseverance, and exertion" that the writer brought to all his work, including his topical journalism and the brilliant if comparatively little-known essays collected as "The Uncommercial Traveller." Individual chapters, and long ones at that, are devoted to the composition of each of the major books, in particular the panoramic "condition of England" novels of the author's later years: "Bleak House," "Little Dorrit" and "Our Mutual Friend." Throughout his pages, Slater periodically insists that Dickens's greatest love wasn't Maria Beadnell, who rejected him when young and then reappeared in middle-age having grown fat and lost her looks, nor Catherine Hogarth, the woman he married (and later cruelly wrote out of his life). Neither was it Catherine's younger sister Mary, who died in Dickens's arms and whose ring he wore from then on, nor even Ternan. No, above all these, Dickens loved his adoring public and quickly established an intimate, almost bloglike relationship with his readers through his prefaces, talks and journalism and, of course, by publishing his work in weekly or monthly magazine installments. People came to think of "Boz" -- the pen name he adopted for his earliest sketches -- as virtually a friend of the family. Over the course of his life, the lionized Dickens met Queen Victoria and two American presidents, counted Washington Irving and Longfellow among his American admirers, regularly socialized with fellow litterateurs Edward Bulwer Lytton, Thomas Carlyle and Wilkie Collins. Hans Christian Andersen once stayed with him for five weeks. "Boz" was even interviewed by two writers whose imaginative intensity rivaled his own: Edgar Allan Poe and Fyodor Dostoevsky. To the latter, Dickens confessed that there were two people in him, one good, one bad. The Russian shot back, "Only two people?" (I love that.) Still, it is amazing that a mere decade after he had started writing, the 34-year-old Charles Dickens was world famous and the first of a series of collected works -- the so-called Cheap Edition -- was being published, to be followed in his lifetime by the Library Edition, the People's Edition and the Charles Dickens Edition, among others. When the novelist died of a stroke, halfway through "The Mystery of Edwin Drood," he was only 58, though photographs make him look 20 years older. By all accounts, he simply seems to have burned himself out, like some literary version of the alcoholic Krook, who notoriously self-combusts. Many modern readers, I think, rather neglect Dickens, disdaining him as melodramatic and sentimental. Instead, we revere Jane Austen for her subtle wit or turn to Henry James for his delicate analyses of human motivation. But Dickens really is our prose Shakespeare. For proof, try almost any of his novels or just watch a DVD of the Royal Shakespeare Company or the BBC dramatizations of "Nicholas Nickleby," "Oliver Twist" or "David Copperfield." When Thackeray, whose "Vanity Fair" was then being published to wild acclaim, first read the scene of young Paul's death in "Dombey and Son," he famously -- and rightly -- cried out: "There's no writing against such power as this -- one has no chance!" For anybody who wants to know more about this dynamo of Victorian letters, Michael Slater's superb biography is the one to read. bookworld@washpost.com <br>Copyright 2009, The Washington Post.

He and his wife, Rosalynn, founded The Carter Center, a nonprofit organization that prevents and resolves conflicts, enhances freedom and democracy, and improves health around the world. He is the author of numerous books, including <i>Palestine Peace Not Apartheid, An Hour Before Daylight</i> and <i>Our Endangered Values</i>. He received a "Best Spoken Word" Grammy Award for his recording of <i>Our Endangered Values</i>. All of President Carter's proceeds from this series will go to the Maranatha Baptist Church of Plains, Georgia.We Can Have Peace in the Holy Land Introduction<p></p> <br><br> <br>STORM OVER A BOOK<br> <br>I am writing another book about the Middle East because the new president of the United States is facing a major opportunity&#x2014;and responsibility&#x2014;to lead in ending conflict between Israel and its neighbors. The time is now. Peace is possible.<br> <br>The normal path to resolving conflicts in this regional tinderbox should be through political leaders in Israel, Palestine, Syria, and Lebanon, with assistance when needed from Egypt, other Arab nations, and the international community. Yet for the past fifty years the United States has been widely recognized as the essential interlocutor that can provide guidance, encouragement, and support to those who want to find common ground. Unfortunately, most leaders in Washington have not been effective in helping the parties find peace, while making it harder for other potential mediators in Europe, the Near East, and the United Nations to intercede.<br> <br>This peace effort should not be seen as a hopeless case. Five Nobel Peace Prizes have been won by leaders who negotiated successfully in 1979 and in 1993&#x2014;one Egyptian, three Israelis, and one Palestinian. But the unpleasant fact is that there has been no tangible progress during the past decade and a half, despite significant efforts during the last years of the administrations of Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. Recent highly publicized peace talks between Israeli and Palestinian leaders have broached difficult issues but ultimately failed to narrow differences. At the same time, Israel and Syria became engaged early in 2007 in &#x201c;indirect&#x201d; conversations sponsored by Turkey, a fragile Gaza cease-fire has been implemented, and there has been an exchange of prisoners and the remains of others between Israel and Hezbollah but no further plans for easing tension between Israel and Lebanon.<br> <br>As will be explained in the text, one of the notable developments in the region has been the repeated proposal by all twenty-two Arab nations to have normal diplomatic and commercial relations with Israel, provided major U.N. resolutions are honored. They have also said that modifications concerning controversial key issues could be considered in good-faith negotiations. This peace offer has been accepted by all Islamic nations and lauded by top U.S. officials, and Israelis have said it is a good basis for discussion.<br> <br>If pursued aggressively with the full support of the United States and other members of the International Quartet,1 this Arab proposal could provide a promising avenue toward breaking the existing deadlock in promoting peace. This might make possible the formation of a multinational peace force in the West Bank to guarantee Israel&#x2019;s security, the release of prisoners (including a prominent jailed leader, Marwan Barghouti, who might heal divisions), updating the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) to include members from Hamas and other factions, and reconciliation between the two major Palestinian political parties. If a general framework could be forged, it would be difficult for minor factions to block a peace agreement.<br> <br>Absent any real progress, conditions continue to fester, with Palestinians divided into two major parties. One group, Fatah, is &#x201c;governing&#x201d; in some parts of the West Bank not controlled by Israel (see Map 1, which shows actual control), supported officially by the international community as the dominant element of the PLO. Mahmoud Abbas was elected president of the Palestinian Authority to succeed Yasir Arafat, and he heads an interim government with most members from his Fatah Party. The other major group, Hamas, controls the small area of Gaza under the leadership of a group of local militants and more influential leaders of the politburo in Damascus, Syria. There are loyal supporters of these two major parties in both Gaza and the West Bank, and some tentative efforts are detectable among them and from other Arab leaders to reunite the two factions. As will be explained in Chapter 10, unified Palestinians, with a workable government and a competent security force, are a prerequisite to any substantive peace agreement with Israel, but these initiatives have been blocked or undermined by mutual animosity and by opposition from Jerusalem and Washington.<br> <br>It has not been possible for the weak and divided Palestinian leadership to eliminate acts of violence against Israel from within the occupied territories, and many Israelis are fearful for their personal safety and for the ultimate security of their nation. To defend themselves, they accept their government&#x2019;s policy of harsh reprisals and the constant expansion of settlements, although the majority of Israelis do not support the settlements as an alternative to peace. Except for some in-frequent public statements and assurances given to me based on the prospect of an Israeli-PLO peace agreement, Hamas has not acknowledged Israel&#x2019;s right to exist and will not forgo violence as a means of ending the occupation of Palestinian territory.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>For more than three decades, a major focus of my personal interests and political activities has been to help end the conflict among Israelis and their neighbors. As president of the United States and a leader of The Carter Center, I have had a special opportunity to study the complex and interrelated issues and to consult with leaders of all significant factions in the region who have been involved in these issues and will have to play key roles in reaching this elusive goal. I have learned some useful lessons, which I hope will help the reader understand the current situation more clearly.<br> <br>Despite the recent lack of progress, I see this as a unique time for hope, not despair. The outlines of a peace agreement are clear and have broad international support. There is a remarkable compatibility among pertinent United Nations resolutions, previous peace agreements reached at Camp David and in Oslo, the publicly declared policy of the United States, the Geneva Accord, key goals of the International Quartet&#x2019;s Roadmap for Peace, and tentative proposals made by all Arab nations for reconciliation with Israel. Perhaps most important, there is an overwhelming common desire for peaceful and prosperous lives among the citizens of Israel, Palestine,2 Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and Egypt. Tentative steps are being taken or contemplated by these players, all waiting to be consummated with American leadership.<br> <br>We already have a firm promise from our new president that he will make a personal effort for Middle East peace from the beginning of his administration. The United States will find all parties to the conflict&#x2014;and leaders of other nations&#x2014;eager to support strong, fair, and persistent leadership from Washington. This will not be easy. Everyone who engages in Middle East peacemaking is bound to make mistakes and suffer frustrations. Everyone must overcome the presence of hatred and fanaticism, and the memories of horrible tragedies. Everyone must face painful choices and failures in negotiations. Nevertheless, I am convinced that the time is ripe for peace in the region.<br> <br>In the following pages I will describe&#x2014;as succinctly and clearly as possible&#x2014;the past history, my own personal involvement and observations, present circumstances, key players, and steps that can and must be taken by the president of the United States to realize this dream of peace, with justice, in the Holy Land. Experiences of the recent past offer valuable lessons as to what to avoid and how to proceed.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>In fact, I learned a lot from the reaction to the publication of my book Palestine Peace Not Apartheid. When I completed the text of this book about Palestine in the summer of 2006, there had not been a day of peace talks for more than five years. In addition, there was no discussion in our country of the basic issues involved, and little interest in the subject. I and others representing The Carter Center had monitored three elections in the occupied territories and had gained an intimate knowledge of the people in the West Bank and Gaza and the issues that shaped their lives. I wanted a good forum to present my views, and I felt that explaining my book throughout the country would best meet this need.<br> <br>I knew from experience how very difficult it was to sustain any objective political analysis in the United States of this important subject, primarily because few prominent political candidates or officeholders would voice any criticism of the current policies of the Israeli government. This meant that news media that were inclined to be objective had little to report other than occasional stories originated by their correspondents in the Middle East. On my visits to the region I found these reporters very knowledgeable, and they shared many of my concerns. I felt a personal responsibility to describe the situation, as best I could, to the American public, the news media, and members of Congress. I wanted to stimulate debate and perhaps some interest in reviving the moribund peace process. These were the underlying purposes of my book.<br> <br>For most American readers, my book was the first time they had encountered both sides of these complex issues, including some rare criticism of Israeli policies in the occupied territories. Only by explaining both perspectives would it be possible to see how differences could be resolved and peace achieved.<br> <br>As the text neared completion, I wanted a title that would be both descriptive and provocative. The working name on my computer was simply &#x201c;Palestine Peace,&#x201d; but I didn&#x2019;t consider this to be adequate. I also tried &#x201c;Land, Walls, Guns, or Peace,&#x201d; and finally decided on &#x201c;Palestine Peace Not &#x2014;&#x2014;,&#x201d; and began to search for the most descriptive final word. Over a period of weeks it became clear that it was apartheid, a word that had been used many times by prominent Israelis, Israeli news media, and visiting observers. These included a former attorney general, scholars and legislators, editors of major newspapers, human rights organizations, and litigants who appealed to the Israeli Supreme Court. Many of them used and explained the word in harsher terms than I, pointing out that this occupation and oppression are contrary to the tenets of the Jewish faith and the basic principles of the nation of Israel. Nelson Mandela, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and human rights activists from South Africa who visited the territories had used the same description.<br> <br>I intended the word apartheid to describe a situation where two peoples dwelling on the same land are forcibly segregated from each other, and one group dominates the other. I thought the title and text would make it clear that the book was about conditions and events in the Palestinian territories and not in Israel and that the forced separation and domination of Arabs by Israelis were based on the acquisition of land and not on race, as had been the case in South Africa.<br> <br>I realized that this might cause some concern in Israel and among Israel&#x2019;s supporters in America, but I intended to emphasize these distinctions in dozens of public presentations. Before this happened, I had copies delivered directly to the offices of all members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. This proved to be a mistake. Without claiming to have read the text, some prominent Democrats condemned the title, and this provided the basis for many of the questions during my subsequent media discussions.<br> <br>In more than a hundred interviews and many speeches, I found the questioning to be challenging and not unpleasant, but I was surprised and distressed when I was accused of being an anti-Semite, senile, a liar, a plagiarist, a racist, unfamiliar with the region, and a supporter of terrorism&#x2014;these charges were made in public statements and in full-page newspaper advertisements. This was especially painful because some of the ad hominem attacks came from Jewish friends and organizations that had been supporters and allies while I was president and during the succeeding years.<br> <br>In retrospect, I should have realized that the previous use of the word apartheid during the spirited debates in Israel had already aroused the sensitivity of many Israeli supporters in America about Israel&#x2019;s being equated with the racist regime in South Africa. To introduce it into an almost nonexistent discussion of the Palestinian issue in our country was highly controversial. Another factor was a carryover from my presidential years, of doubts about my commitment to Israel, as will be described in Chapters 2 and 3. Also, I underestimated the debating skills of those with whom I was now engaged, and was surprised by their personal attacks. Another mistake was not attempting to build earlier and broader political support among groups that were dedicated to peace in the Middle East.<br> <br>I was eager to explain my thesis to every available audience, but I especially enjoyed the exchanges at a number of universities where I spoke and then answered questions from large groups of students. In each case I urged them and their professors to visit Palestine and ascertain whether I had exaggerated or mistakenly described the situation. Christian travel groups and other tourists were encouraged to visit Bethlehem and other holy sites within Palestine to observe the intrusive wall and the devastating impact of the occupation on the lives of Palestinian Christians.<br> <br>Although I did not enjoy some of the criticisms, the book and my explanations of it did bring about a debate, which was my principal goal. In addition, President Bush finally announced a peace initiative, to begin with a conference in Annapolis, Maryland, with observers invited from a wide range of countries.<br> <br>In August 2006, Jeff Skoll, chairman of Participant Productions, asked if I would permit a full-length documentary film to be made about my work at The Carter Center. He was the first president of eBay and more recently had produced the Al Gore film, An Inconvenient Truth, and several other motion pictures that accumulated eleven Oscar nominations that year. Later, I agreed to the proposal when he informed me that Jonathan Demme (The Silence of the Lambs, Philadelphia) had offered to direct the film.<br> <br>Jonathan and I considered several theme options, including our Carter Center work in Africa and our Habitat for Humanity projects building homes in the area of the Gulf Coast damaged by Hurricane Katrina. He finally decided just to follow me around with high-definition cameras and record my daily activities. In November, his filming included the early days of travels to explain the Palestine book. There were dramatic news media interviews, discussions, arguments, speeches, book signings, and demonstrations that produced more than a hundred hours of recorded activities. These were interspersed with more tranquil scenes as I lectured at Emory University, interrelated with my neighbors and family, taught Bible lessons, made furniture, painted, exercised, and performed the duties of a farmer. Titled Jimmy Carter Man from Plains, the motion picture premiered in July 2007 and won several awards at film festivals. The high point of the film was my lecture and exchanges with the students at Brandeis University, which were charged with emotion and encapsulated the complex factors that must be addressed in the search for peace.<br> <br>1.&nbsp;The United Nations, the United States, Russia, and the European Union.<br> <br>2.&nbsp;I will sometimes use &#x201c;the Holy Land&#x201d; to mean the entire area between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, bounded on the north by Lebanon a...</p><h2>Network Flows: Theory, Algorithms, and Applications</h2><p><p> A comprehensive introduction to network flows that brings together the classic and the contemporary aspects of the field, and provides an integrative view of theory, algorithms, and applications. </p> <p> <br> </p> <li>presents in-depth, self-contained treatments of shortest path, maximum flow, and minimum cost flow problems, including descriptions of polynomial-time algorithms for these core models.</li> <ul> <li>emphasizes powerful algorithmic strategies and analysis tools such as data scaling, geometric improvement arguments, and potential function arguments.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>provides an easy-to-understand descriptions of several important data structures, including d-heaps, Fibonacci heaps, and dynamic trees.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>devotes a special chapter to conducting empirical testing of algorithms.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>features over 150 applications of network flows to a variety of engineering, management, and scientific domains.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>contains extensive reference notes and illustrations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li> </ul></p><p>A comprehensive introduction to network flows that brings together the classic and the contemporary aspects of the field, and provides an integrative view of theory, algorithms, and applications.Bringing together the classic and the contemporary aspects of the field, this comprehensive introduction to network flows provides an integrative view of theory, algorithms, and applications.<p>It offers in-depth and self-contained treatments of shortest path, maximum flow, and minimum cost flow problems, including a description of new and novel polynomial-time algorithms for these core models.

(Columbia Themes in Philosophy)</h2><p>Noam Chomsky is widely known and deeply admired for being the founder of modern linguistics, one of the founders of the field of cognitive science, and perhaps the most avidly read political theorist and commentator of our time. In these lectures, he presents a lifetime of philosophical reflection on all three of these areas of research, to which he has contributed for over half a century.<br><br>In clear, precise, and nontechnical language, Chomsky elaborates on fifty years of scientific development in the study of language, sketching how his own work has implications for the origins of language, the close relations that language bears to thought, and its eventual biological basis. He expounds and criticizes many alternative theories, such as those that emphasize the social, the communicative, and the referential aspects of language. Chomsky reviews how new discoveries about language overcome what seemed to be highly problematic assumptions in the past. He also investigates the apparent scope and limits of human cognitive capacities and what the human mind can seriously investigate, in the light of history of science and philosophical reflection and current understanding. Moving from language and mind to society and politics, he concludes with a searching exploration and philosophical defense of a position he describes as "libertarian socialism," tracing its links to anarchism and the ideas of John Dewey and even to the ideas of Marx and Mill, demonstrating its conceptual growth out of our historical past and urgent relation to matters of the present.</p><p>In clear, precise, and non-technical language, Chomsky elaborates on fifty years of scientific development in the study of language, sketching how his own work has implications for the origins of language, the close relations that language bears to thought, and its biological basis.

Non-analysts are frequently both baffled and alienated by the jargon and the complexity of works which extend psychoanalytical thinking, but Ogden is revealed in this book as an outstanding communicator as well as a major theoretician. The book&#39;s subtitle is a guide to the main focus of the work, which reinterprets the work of Melanie Klein, with its focus on phantasy, in relation to the biological determinants of perception and the meaning and organization of experience in the interpersonal setting of human growth and development. Ogden re-interprets Klein to illuminate Freudian instinct theory, using the contributions of Bion, Fairbairn, and particularly WinnicottDBritish object relations theoristsDto clarify and extend aspects of their work and to move towards an impressive exposition of the way in which the human mind develops.&#39; DPamela M. Ashurst, The British Journal of Psychiatry A Jason Aronson Book</p><p>Thomas H. Ogden, M.D., is a graduate of Amherst College, the Yale School of Medicine, and the San Francisco Psychoanalytic Institute. He has served as an associate psychiatrist at the Tavistock Clinic, London, and is currently co-director of the Center for the Advanced Study of the Psychoses, a member of the faculty of the San Francisco Psychoanalytic Institute, and a supervising and personal analyst at the Psychoanalytic Institute of Northern California. He teaches, supervises, and maintains a private practice of psychoanalysis in San Francisco.All who are acquainted with Thomas Ogden's papers on psychoanalysis and with his authoritative book Projective Identification and Psychotherapeutic Technique have eagerly awaited the publication of The Matrix of the Mind. Ogden supplies an approachto Kleinian theory that is both eminently appreciative and incisively critical. He comprehensively and brilliantly surveys the development of the concept of internal objects and relationships. The chapters dealing with Winnicott's theoretical and clinicalcontribution to the history of psychoanalytic thought are particularly profound and original. This eminently readable and thought-provoking book will be read with interest not only by dedicated psychotherapeutic workers in varied fields, but also by allthose who take an intelligent interest in the way human beings function psychologically.. (Joyce McDougall, D. Ed.)<br><br>[Ogden's] ideas will eventually have the importance of transference and countertransference and projection and projective identification in psychoanalytic theory. Ogden's writing is crisp and clear when combining welters of seemingly confusing concepts. It taps the root of yet another American grain. The British came, they saw, and psychologists will never be the same. We are building a new dialectic of the psychology and understanding of deep structures and matrices of the mind.... (Harold J. Fine)<br><br>The Matrix of the Mind provides us with the most profound understanding to date of both the strengths and the weaknesses of Melanie Klein. In so doing, Ogden establishes himself as one of the most eloquent American spokesmen for the British object relations school. [Ogden] is an independent thinker who appreciates the dialectical nature of the psychoanalytic endeavor. The Freudian thesis requires the Kleinian antithesis in Ogden's view, and neither Freud nor Klein can be fully understood without understanding the other. Ogden does not hesitate to point out the shortcomings of Klein; and he persuasively demonstrates that the contributions of Winnicott, particularly those concerning the potential space, fill the void left by the formulations of Klein.As an experienced psychoanalytic therapist involved in the treatment of severely disturbed patients, Ogden repeatedly anchors his brilliant conceptual thinking to the bedrock of clinical data. The test of any psychoanalytic theory is in its application to the understanding of patients, and it is here that the author's thinking is vindicated. The clinician who reads this volume will be richly rewarded by his expanded understanding of his patients and of the therapeutic process. (Glen O.

With hilarious yet endearing portraits of his eccentric family and their many unusual hangers-on, <i>My Family and Other Animals</i> also captures the beginnings of Durrell's lifelong love of animals. In its passionate understanding of Corfu's natural history, this is an entertaining and enduring memoir.</p><p>As a self-described "champion of small uglies," English writer Gerald Durrell (1925-1995) devoted his life to writing and the preservation of wildlife, from the Mauritius pink pigeon to the Rodriques fruit bat. <i>My Family and Other Animals</i> was intended to embrace the natural history of the Greek island of Corfu, but ended up as a delightful account of his family's experiences that were, according to him, "rather like living in one of the more flamboyant and slapstick comic operas." <p> As a 10-year-old boy, Gerry left England for Corfu with "all those items that I thought necessary to relieve the tedium of a long journey: four books on natural history, a butterfly net, a dog, and a jam-jar full of caterpillars all in imminent danger of turning into chrysalids." Durrell's descriptions of his family and its many eccentric hangers-on (he stresses that "all the anecdotes about the island and the islanders are absolutely true") are highly entertaining, as is the procession of toads, scorpions, geckos, ladybugs, glowworms, octopuses, the puppies Widdle and Puke, and the Magenpies. This is a lovely book.</p>Gerald Durrell was born in Jamshedpur, India, in 1925. A student of zoology, he founded the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust on the Channel Island of Jersey. His other books include <i>A Zoo in My Luggage</i> and <i>The Whispering Land</i>.</p><h2>Cost Accounting: A Managerial Emphasis</h2><p>Pearsoddison Wesley, 2011. Soft cover. Book Condition: New.

Written by a world-class authority on textual criticism, it links grammar and exegesis to provide today&#39;s second-year Greek student with solid exegetical and linguistic foundations.</p><p>For seminary students, the goal of studying Greek grammar is the accurate exegesis of biblical texts. Sound exegesis requires that the exegete consider grammar within a larger framework that includes context, lexeme, and other linguistic features. <p>While the trend of some grammarians has been to take a purely grammatical approach to the language, Greek Grammar Beyond the Basics integrates the technical requirements for proper Greek interpretation with the actual interests and needs of Bible students. It is the first textbook to systematically link syntax and exegesis of the New Testament for second-year Greek students. It explores numerous syntactical categories, some of which have not previously been dealt with in print. </p><p>Greek Grammar Beyond the Basics is the most up-to-date Greek grammar available. It equips intermediate Greek students with the skills they need to do exegesis of biblical texts in a way that is faithful to their intended meaning. The expanded edition contains a subject index, a Greek word index, and page numbers in the Syntax Summary section.</p>Daniel B.

While Dow is known as the mentor of Georgia O'Keeffe and Max Weber, his legacy as a proponent of modern art has suffered undeserved neglect by recent artists and art historians.<br><br>In <i>Composition</i> Dow develops a system for teaching students to create freely constructed images on the basis of harmonic relations between lines, colors, and dark and light patterns. Greatly influenced by Japanese art, he expounds a theory of "flat" formal equilibrium as an essential component of telling pictorial creation. Generations of teachers and their public school pupils learned from Dow's orientalism and adopted basic postimpressionist principles without even knowing the term. The reappearance of Dow's practical, well-illustrated guide, enhanced by Joseph Masheck's discussion of its historical ramifications, is an important event for all concerned with the visual arts and the intellectual antecedents of American modernism.</p><p>"<i>Composition</i> is a great classic that had immense influence on thinking about art during the first decades of the twentieth century; it is still a challenging statement about the nature of effective visual representation, and it remains of special interest to students of the history of art."&#x2015;Richard Shiff, University of Texas, Austin<b>Arthur Wesley Dow</b> (1857-1922) was a painter, printmaker, and writer.

Includes an examination of how Crow&#39;s risky strategy of making all principals partners in his firm and offering equity interest to deal managers paid off with spectacular profits. A lively account of Crow&#39;s mission to break all the rules and become the greatest builder of our age.</p><p>Real estate mogul Crow will never rival Donald Trump in terms of public recognition nor, as this intricate biography details, would he want to do so. Business writer Sobel explores in painstaking detail one of the most complexly organized business entities in the world and the humble yet extraordinary entrepreneur behind it. Reported to be several times larger than Trump's, Crow's empire encompasses a mind-boggling array of warehouses, hotels, hospitals, residential developments, and more. The knottiness of the Crow story makes this of limited appeal to general readers, except perhaps where Crow's influence is strongest--Texas, Atlanta, and the entire South. However, comprehensive business collections will want to include this for singular case study value.<br><i>- David M. Turkalo, Social Law Lib., Boston</i><br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.The international Dallas-based empire built by charismatic real-estate mogul Crow dwarfs the holdings of tycoons such as William Zeckendorf and Donald Trump, according to this entertaining chronicle by business columnist Sobel ( The Big Board ). The success of Crow, a former accountant with no real-estate experience or training in architecture, was due in large measure to his practice of involving his associates as full partners in a wide range of commercial and residential projects, in return for equity, Sobel maintains. He traces the evolution of Crow's enterprises from a loose, weblike network in 1948 into the more structured, centralized corporate entity required by the altered economic conditions of the mid-1970s.

Philip of Macedonia was assassinated and his twenty-year-old son, Alexander, inherited his kingdom. Immediately quelling rebellion, Alexander extended his father&#x2019;s empire through-out the Middle East and into parts of Asia, fulfilling the soothsayer Aristander&#x2019;s prediction that the new king &#x201c;should perform acts so important and glorious as would make the poets and musicians of future ages labour and sweat to describe and celebrate him.&#x201d; <br><br><b>The Life of Alexander the Great</b> is one of the first surviving attempts to memorialize the achievements of this legendary king, remembered today as the greatest military genius of all time. This exclusive Modern Library edition, excerpted from <b>Plutarch&#x2019;s Lives</b>, is a riveting tale of honor, power, scandal, and bravery written by the most eminent biographer of the ancient world.</p><p><b>About the Introducer<br><br>VICTOR DAVIS HANSON</b> has written extensively on both ancient Greek and military history; his ?fteen books include <b>The Western Way of War </b>and<b> Between War and Peace</b>. He is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University, and a professor of classics at California State University, Fresno.It being my purpose to write the lives of Alexander the king, and of C�sar, by whom Pompey was destroyed, the multitude of their great actions affords so large a field that I were to blame if I should not by way of apology forewarn my reader that I have chosen rather to epitomise the most celebrated parts of their story, than to insist at large on every particular circumstance of it. It must be borne in mind that my design is not to write histories, but lives. And the most glorious exploits do not always furnish us with the clearest discoveries of virtue or vice in men; sometimes a matter of less moment, an expression or a jest, informs us better of their characters and inclinations, than the most famous sieges, the greatest armaments, or the bloodiest battles whatsoever. Therefore as portrait-painters are more exact in the lines and features of the face, in which the character is seen, than in the other parts of the body, so I must be allowed to give my more particular attention to the marks and indications of the souls of men, and while I endeavour by these to portray their lives, may be free to leave more weighty matters and great battles to be treated of by others.<br><br>It is agreed on by all hands, that on the father&#x2019;s side, Alexander descended from Hercules by Caranus, and from �acus by Neoptolemus on the mother&#x2019;s side. His father Philip, being in Samothrace, when he was quite young, fell in love there with Olympias, in company with whom he was initiated in the religious ceremonies of the country, and her father and mother being both dead, soon after, with the consent of her brother, Arymbas, he married her. The night before the consummation of their marriage, she dreamed that a thunderbolt fell upon her body, which kindled a great fire, whose divided flames dispersed themselves all about, and then were extinguished. And Philip, some time after he was married, dreamt that he sealed up his wife&#x2019;s body with a seal, whose impression, as he fancied, was the figure of a lion. Some of the diviners interpreted this as a warning to Philip to look narrowly to his wife; but Aristander of Telmessus, considering how unusual it was to seal up anything that was empty, assured him the meaning of his dream was that the queen was with child of a boy, who would one day prove as stout and courageous as a lion. Once, moreover, a serpent was found lying by Olympias as she slept, which more than anything else, it is said, abated Philip&#x2019;s passion for her; and whether he feared her as an enchantress, or thought she had commerce with some god, and so looked on himself as excluded, he was ever after less fond of her conversation. Others say, that the women of this country having always been extremely addicted to the enthusiastic Orphic rites, and the wild worship of Bacchus (upon which account they were called Clodones, and Mimallones), imitated in many things the practices of the Edonian and Thracian women about Mount H�mus, from whom the word threskeuein seems to have been derived, as a special term for superfluous and over-curious forms of adoration; and that Olympias, zealously affecting these fanatical and enthusiastic inspirations, to perform them with more barbaric dread, was wont in the dances proper to these ceremonies to have great tame serpents about her, which sometimes creeping out of the ivy in the mystic fans, sometimes winding themselves about the sacred spears, and the women&#x2019;s chaplets, made a spectacle which men could not look upon without terror.<br><br>Philip, after this vision, sent Ch�ron of Megalopolis to consult the oracle of Apollo at Delphi, by which he was commanded to perform sacrifice, and henceforth pay particular honour, above all other gods, to Ammon; and was told he should one day lose that eye with which he presumed to peep through that chink of the door, when he saw the god, under the form of a serpent, in the company of his wife. Eratosthenes says that Olympias, when she attended Alexander on his way to the army in his first expedition, told him the secret of his birth, and bade him behave himself with courage suitable to his divine extraction. Others again affirm that she wholly disclaimed any pretensions of the kind, and was wont to say, &#x201c;When will Alexander leave off slandering me to Juno?&#x201d; Alexander was born the sixth of Hecatomb�on, which month the Macedonians call Lous, the same day that the temple of Diana at Ephesus was burnt; which Hegesias of Magnesia makes the occasion of a conceit, frigid enough to have stopped the conflagration. The temple, he says, took fire and was burnt while its mistress was absent, assisting at the birth of Alexander. And all the Eastern soothsayers who happened to be then at Ephesus, looking upon the ruin of this temple to be the forerunner of some other calamity, ran about the town, beating their faces, and crying that this day had brought forth something that would prove fatal and destructive to all Asia.<br><br>Just after Philip had taken Potid�a, he received these three messages at one time, that Parmenio had overthrown the Illyrians in a great battle, that his race-horse had won the course at the Olympic games, and that his wife had given birth to Alexander; with which being naturally well pleased, as an addition to his satisfaction, he was assured by the diviners that a son, whose birth was accompanied with three such successes, could not fail of being invincible.<br><br>The statues that gave the best representation of Alexander&#x2019;s person were those of Lysippus (by whom alone he would suffer his image to be made), those peculiarities which many of his successors afterwards and his friends used to affect to imitate, the inclination of his head a little on one side towards his left shoulder, and his melting eye, having been expressed by this artist with great exactness. But Apelles, <br><br>who drew him with thunderbolts in his hand, made his complexion browner and darker than it was naturally; for he was fair and of a light colour, passing into ruddiness in his face and upon his breast. Aristoxenus in his Memoirs tells us that a most agreeable odour exhaled from his skin, and that his breath and body all over was so fragrant as to perfume the clothes which he wore next him; the cause of which might probably be the hot and adust temperament of his body. For sweet smells, Theophrastus conceives, are produced by the concoction of moist humours by heat, which is the reason that those parts of the world which are driest and most burnt up afford spices of the best kind and in the greatest quantity; for the heat of the sun exhausts all the superfluous moisture which lies in the surface of bodies, ready to generate putrefaction. And this hot constitution, it may be, rendered Alexander so addicted to drinking, and so choleric. His temperance, as to the pleasures of the body, was apparent in him in his very childhood, as he was with much difficulty incited to them, and always used them with great moderation; though in other things he was extremely eager and vehement, and in his love of glory, and the pursuit of it, he showed a solidity of high spirit and magnanimity far above his age. For he neither sought nor valued it upon every occasion, as his father Philip did (who affected to show his eloquence almost to a degree of pedantry, and took care to have the victories of his racing chariots at the Olympic games engraven on his coin), but when he was asked by some about him, whether he would run a race in the Olympic games, as he was very swift-footed, he answered, he would, if he might have kings to run with him. Indeed, he seems in general to have looked with indifference, if not with dislike, upon the professed athletes. He often appointed prizes, for which not only tragedians and musicians, pipers and harpers, but rhapsodists also, strove to outvie one another; and delighted in all manner of hunting and cudgel-playing, but never gave any encouragement to contests either of boxing or of the pancratium.<br><br>While he was yet very young, he entertained the ambassadors from the King of Persia, in the absence of his father, and entering much into conversation with them, gained so much upon them by his affability, and the questions he asked them, which were far from being childish or trifling (for he inquired of them the length of the ways, the nature of the road into inner Asia, the character of their king, how he carried himself to his enemies, and what forces he was able to bring into the field), that they were struck with admiration of him, and looked upon the ability so much famed of Philip to be nothing in comparison with the forwardness and high purpose that appeared thus early in his son. Whenever he heard Philip had taken any town of importance, or won any signal victory, instead of rejoicing at it altogether, he would tell his companions that his father would anticipate everything, and leave him and them no opportunities of performing great and illustrious actions. For being more bent upon action and glory than either upon pleasure or riches, he esteemed all that he should receive from his father as a diminution and prevention of his own future achievements; and would have chosen rather to succeed to a kingdom involved in troubles and wars, which would have afforded him frequent exercise of his courage, and a large field of honour, than to one already flourishing and settled where his inheritance would be an inactive life, and the mere enjoyment of wealth and luxury.<br><br>The care of his education, as it might be presumed, was committed to a great many attendants, preceptors, and teachers, over the whole of whom Leonidas, a near kinsman of Olympias, a man of an austere temper, presided, who did not indeed himself decline the name of what in reality is a noble and honourable office, but in general his dignity, and his near relationship, obtained him from other people the title of Alexander&#x2019;s foster-father and governor. But he who took upon him the actual place and style of his pedagogue was Lysimachus the Acarnanian, who, though he had nothing specially to recommend him, but his lucky fancy of calling himself Ph&#x153;nix, Alexander Achilles, and Philip Peleus, was therefore well enough esteemed, and ranked in the next degree after Leonidas.<br><br>Philonicus the Thessalian brought the horse Bucephalus to Philip, offering to sell him for thirteen talents; but when they went into the field to try him, they found him so very vicious and unmanageable, that he reared up when they endeavoured to mount him, and would not so much as endure the voice of any of Philip&#x2019;s attendants. Upon which, as they were leading him away as wholly useless and untractable, Alexander, who stood by, said, &#x201c;What an excellent horse do they lose for want of address and boldness to manage him!&#x201d; Philip at first took no notice of what he said; but when he heard him repeat the same thing several times, and saw he was much vexed to see the horse sent away, &#x201c;Do you reproach,&#x201d; said he to him, &#x201c;those who are older than yourself, as if you knew more, and were better able to manage him than they?&#x201d; &#x201c;I could manage this horse,&#x201d; replied he, &#x201c;better than others do.&#x201d; &#x201c;And if you do not,&#x201d; said Philip, &#x201c;what will you forfeit for your rashness?&#x201d; &#x201c;I will pay,&#x201d; answered Alexander, &#x201c;the whole price of the horse.&#x201d; At this the whole company fell a-laughing; and as soon as the wager was settled amongst them, he immediately ran to the horse, and taking hold of the bridle, turned him directly towards the sun, having, it seems, observed that he was disturbed at and afraid of the motion of his own shadow; then letting him go forward a little still keeping the reins in his hands, and stroking him gently when he found him begin to grow eager and fiery, he let fall his upper garment softly, and with one nimble leap securely mounted him, and when he was seated, by little and little drew in the bridle, and curbed him without either striking or spurring him. Presently, when he found him free from all rebelliousness, and only impatient for the course, he let him go at full speed, inciting him now with a commanding voice, and urging him also with his heel. Philip and his friends looked on at first in silence and anxiety for the result, till seeing him turn at the end of his career, and come back rejoicing and triumphing for what he had performed, they all burst out into acclamations of applause; and his father shedding tears, it is said, for joy, kissed him as he came down from his horse, and in his transport said, &#x201c;O my son, look thee out a kingdom equal to and worthy of thyself, for Macedonia is too little for thee.&#x201d;<br><br>After this, considering him to be of a temper easy to be led to his duty by reason, but by no means to be compelled, he always endeavoured to persuade rather than to command or force him to anything; and now looking upon the instruction and tuition of his youth to be of greater difficulty and importance than to be wholly trusted to the ordinary masters in music and poetry, and the common school subjects, and to require, as Sophocles says&#x2014;<br><br>&#x201c;The bridle and the rudder too,&#x201d;<br><br>he sent for Aristotle, the most learned and most celebrated philosopher of his time, and rewarded him with a munificence proportionable to and becoming the care he took to instruct his son. For he repeopled his native city Stagira, which he had caused to be demolished a little before, and restored all the citizens, who were in exile or slavery, to their habitations. As a place for the pursuit of their studies and exercise, he assigned the temple of the Nymphs, near Mieza, where, to this very day, they show you Aristotle&#x2019;s stone seats, and the shady walks which he was wont to frequent. It would appear that Alexander received from him not only his doctrines of Morals and of Politics, but also something of those more abstruse and profound theories which these philosophers, by the very names they gave them, professed to reserve for oral communication to the initiated, and did not allow many to become acquainted with. For when he was in Asia, and heard Aristotle had published some treatises of that kind, he wrote to him, using very plain language to him in behalf of philosophy, the following letter. &#x201c;Alexander to Aristotle, greeting. You have not done well to publish your books of oral doctrine; for what is there now that we excel others in, if those things which we have been particularly instructed in be laid open to all? For my part, I assure you, I had rather excel others in the knowledge of what is excellent, than in the extent of my power and dominion. Farewell.&#x201d; And Aristotle, soothing this passion for pre-eminence, speaks, in his excuse for himself, of these doctrines as in fact both published and not published: as indeed, to say the truth, his books on metaphysics are written in a style which makes them useless for ordinary teaching, and instructive only, in the way of memoranda, for those who have been already conversant in that sort of learning.<br><br>Doubtless also it was to Aristotle that he owed the inclination he had, not to the theory only, but likewise to the practice of the art of medicine. For when any of his friends were sick, he would often prescribe them their course of diet, and medicines proper to their disease, as we may find in his epistles. He was naturally a great lover of all kinds of learning and reading; and Onesicritus informs us that he constantly laid Homer&#x2019;s Iliads, according to the copy corrected by Aristotle, called the casket copy, with his dagger under his pillow, declaring that he esteemed it a perfect portable treasure of all military virtue and knowledge. When he was in the upper Asia, being destitute of other books, he ordered Harpalus to send him some; who furnished him with Philistus&#x2019;s History, a great many of the plays of Euripides, Sophocles, and �schylus, and some dithyrambic odes, composed by Telestes and Philoxenus.

He is swift to befriend her and steadfastly refutes the local gossip calling her character and behaviour into question, yet he soon has cause to regret his infatuation, and grave doubts and misgivings begin to arise in his mind. It is only when Helen presents Gilbert with her diary and instructs him to read it that the shocking truth about her past life becomes clear.</p><p>The first edition of <i>The Tenant of Wildfell Hall</i> was so successful that it sold out in weeks, yet the novel was mired in controversy for its fierce defence of women's rights and what many contemporary critics viewed as its shocking and immoral subject matter.</p></p><p>Anne Bront� (1820&#x2013;1849), the youngest of the Bront� sisters, wrote two successful novels, <i>The Tenant of Wildfell Hall</i> and <i>Agnes Grey</i>. Like her siblings Emily and Branwell, her life was tragically cut short by tuberculosis.Anne Bronte attacks her problem with a freedom and audacity before which her sisters&#39; boldest enterprises seem cowardly and restrained.

At nineteen, she became the first black American poet to publish a book, <i>Poems on Various Subjects: Religious and Moral,</i> on which this volume is based. Wheatley's poetry created a sensation throughout the English-speaking world, and the young poet read her work in aristocratic drawing rooms on both sides of the Atlantic. The <i>London Chronicle </i>went so far as to declare her "perhaps one of the greatest instances of pure, unassisted genius that the world ever produced." <br>Wheatley's elegies and odes offer fascinating glimpses into the origins of African-American literary traditions. Most of the poems express the effects of her religious and classical New England education, consisting of elegies for the departed and odes to Christian salvation. This edition of Wheatley's historic works includes letters and a biographical note written by one of the poet's descendants. Includes a selection from the Common Core State Standards Initiative: "On Being Brought from Africa to America."</p><p>The first published African-American poet, Phillis Wheatley (1753-84) was born in West Africa, captured, and sold as a slave to the Wheatley family of Boston. Educated alongside her master&#39;s children, Wheatley achieved international renown with her initial poems but slipped into obscurity shortly afterward and died in poverty.</p><h2>The Chip : How Two Americans Invented the Microchip and Launched a Revolution</h2><p>Barely fifty years ago a computer was a gargantuan, vastly expensive thing that only a handful of scientists had ever seen. The world&#x2019;s brightest engineers were stymied in their quest to make these machines small and affordable until the solution finally came from two ingenious young Americans. Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce hit upon the stunning discovery that would make possible the silicon microchip, a work that would ultimately earn Kilby the Nobel Prize for physics in 2000. In this completely revised and updated edition of <b>The Chip</b>, T.R. Reid tells the gripping adventure story of their invention and of its growth into a global information industry. This is the story of how the digital age began.</p><p>They're everywhere, but where did they come from? Silicon chips drive just about everything that sucks power, from toys to heart monitors, but their inventors aren't nearly as widely known as Edison and Ford. Journalist T.R. Reid has thoroughly updated <i>The Chip</i>, his 1985 exploration of the life work of inventors Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce, to reflect the colossal shift toward smarter gadgets that has taken place since then.<p>Satisfying as both biography and basic science text, the book perfectly captures the independence and near-obsessive problem-solving talents of the two men. Though ultimately only one of them (Noyce) ended up with legal rights to the invention, they shared a respect for each other that persisted throughout their careers. Since Kilby won the 2000 Nobel Prize for Physics for his work, the story is all the more compelling and intriguing over 40 years after the invention. Reid's work uncovers human dimensions we'd never expect to see from 1950s engineering research. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>T.R. Reid is the author of five books in English and two in Japanese. Through his reporting for <i>The Washington Post</i>, his syndicated weekly column, and his light-hearted commentary from around the world for National Public Radio, he has become one of America&#x2019;s best-known foreign correspondents.

It moves well beyond the scope of its predecessor, <em>Adrienne Rich's Poetry</em> (1975), in giving proper recognition to Rich's extraordinary achievements in both poetry and prose in recent years. The result is a judiciously edited, sensibly annotated volume ideally suited for classroom study of one of our most distinguished working writers.</strong></p> In both poetry and prose, the editors have chosen selections intended to give readers a clear sense of Rich's evolution and accomplishment. Many of the poems in this expanded collection are from Rich's five recent volumes&#x2015;<em>The Dream of a Common Language</em> (1978), <em>A Wild Patience Has Taken Me This Far</em> (1981), <em>Your Native Land, Your Life</em> (1986), <em>Time's Power: Poems 1985-1988</em> (1989), and <em>An Atlas of the Difficult World</em> (1991). Prose selections include "When We Dead Awaken: Writing as Re-Vision," Rich's canonical statement on feminism; "Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence," on being a lesbian in a heterosexual world; Rich's interview for American Poetry Review, which presents a full and frank discussion of her work; and her previously unpublished commentary on the genesis of the poem "Yom Kippur 1984."<br><br> The editors have also taken into account the many essays on Rich and reviews of her work that have been published since 1975. Some earlier biographical selections have been replaced with works that focus on the quality of Rich's writing and her place in twentieth-century American literature&#x2015;not just as a poet, but as a woman, a lesbian, and a mother. Criticism includes thirteen reviews and interpretations of Rich's work by W. H. Auden, John Ashbery, Margaret Atwood, Helen Vendler, Judith McDaniel, Adrian Oktenberg, Charles Altieri, and Joanna Feit Diehl, among others. A second recent study by Albert Gelpi traces the events in Rich's life from which her work evolves. An updated Chronology and Selected Bibliography, as well as an expanded Index, are included.</p><p><p>Widely read, widely anthologized, widely interviewed, and widely taught, <strong>Adrienne Rich</strong> (1929&#x2013;2012) was for decades among the most influential writers of the feminist movement and one of the best-known American public intellectuals.

It is a long narrow swale between two ranges of mountains, and the Salinas River winds and twists up the center until it falls at last into Monterey Bay.<br><br>I remember my childhood names for grasses and secret flowers. I remember where a toad may live and what time the birds awaken in the summer&#x2014;and what trees and seasons smelled like&#x2014;how people looked and walked and smelled even. The memory of odors is very rich.<br><br>I remember that the Gabilan Mountains to the east of the valley were light gay mountains full of sun and loveliness and a kind of invitation, so that you wanted to climb into their warm foothills almost as you want to climb into the lap of a beloved mother. They were beckoning mountains with a brown grass love. The Santa Lucias stood up against the sky to the west and kept the valley from the open sea, and they were dark and brooding&#x2014;unfriendly and dangerous. I always found in myself a dread of west and a love of east. Where I ever got such an idea I cannot say, unless it could be that the morning came over the peaks of the Gabilans and the night drifted back from the ridges of the Santa Lucias. It may be that the birth and death of the day had some part in my feeling about the two ranges of mountains.<br><br>From both sides of the valley little streams slipped out of the hill canyons and fell into the bed of the Salinas River. In the winter of wet years the streams ran full-freshet, and they swelled the river until sometimes it raged and boiled, bank full, and then it was a destroyer. The river tore the edges of the farm lands and washed whole acres down; it toppled barns and houses into itself, to go floating and bobbing away. It trapped cows and pigs and sheep and drowned them in its muddy brown water and carried them to the sea. Then when the late spring came, the river drew in from its edges and the sand banks appeared. And in the summer the river didn&#x2019;t run at all above ground. Some pools would be left in the deep swirl places under a high bank. The tules and grasses grew back, and willows straightened up with the flood debris in their upper branches. The Salinas was only a part-time river. The summer sun drove it underground. It was not a fine river at all, but it was the only one we had and so we boasted about it&#x2014;how dangerous it was in a wet winter and how dry it was in a dry summer. You can boast about anything if it&#x2019;s all you have. Maybe the less you have, the more you are required to boast.<br> &nbsp;<br><br></p></p><h2>Betty Crocker&#39;s Ultimate Cookie Book</h2><p>A compendium of the world&#39;s best-loved cookie recipes features recipes for drop cookies, rolled cookies, molded cookies, brownies, oatmeal cookies, bar cookies, jam bars, sugar cookies, refrigerator cookies, ten varieties of chocolate chip cookies, and others.</p><p>Johnny Carson may be off the air, and Hope and Crosby can never make another Road movie, but Betty Crocker and her cookies live on in this comforting collection of 175 familiar lunchbox, wedding and holiday recipes. In this Crocker roster of drop, rolled, molded, and specialty cookies, there are some new additions: "Yogurt Stack Cookies" and "Whole Wheat Meltaways" make a nod to the '80s, and "Esther's Bracelets" and hammantaschen to Jewish holidays. But most of the recipes hark back to an earlier, possibly mythic, era, when home-baked cookies were served in front of the Philco with Ovaltine or Postum. Yet, in the best Betty Crocker tradition, these recipes are not dated. The original recipes for chocolate chip cookies, snickerdoodles, holiday spritz and mocha brownies need no improvement. They are standards, calling for few ingredients and made from simple, easy-to-follow recipes. A useful glossary, "All About Cookies," details equipment, ingredients and techniques like shaping, storing, and mailing. For a baker who wants an unadorned, fail-safe assortment of cookie recipes, this one is hard to beat. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Heating with Renewable Energy</h2><p>Whether you are preparing for a career in the building trades or are already a professional contractor, this practical book will help you develop the knowledge and skills you need to merge renewable heat sources (such as solar thermal collectors, hydronic heat pumps, and wood-fired boilers) with the latest hydronics hardware and low temperature distribution systems to assemble efficient and reliable heating systems.

The result is a wide-ranging view of the lives and values of men and women (artisans, tradesmen, the poor) who, because they left little or nothing in writing, have hitherto had little attention from scholars. The first three essays consider the social, vocational, and sexual context of the Protestant Reformation, its consequences for urban women, and the new attitudes toward poverty shared by Catholic humanists and Protestants alike in sixteenth-century Lyon. The next three essays describe the links between festive play and youth groups, domestic dissent, and political criticism in town and country, the festive reversal of sex roles and political order, and the ritualistic and dramatic structure of religious riots. The final two essays discuss the impact of printing on the quasi-literate, and the collecting of common proverbs and medical folklore by learned students of the &#34;people&#34; during the Ancien R�gime. The book includes eight pages of illustrations.</p><p>This classic collection of essays has already established itself as a rich source of material for students of sixteenth and seventeenth-century France. Natalie Davis focuses on the lower social orders - peasants, artisans, the poor generally - and in a series of brilliantly penetrating cast-studies throws fresh light on some of the great issues of social change: the impact of printing, the rise of protestantism, the role of women, power-relations between groups and classes&#39;.Natalie Zemon Davis is Professor of History at the University of California, Berkeley.</p><h2>State and Local Politics: Institutions and Reform</h2><p>In this Fourth Edition of STATE AND LOCAL POLITICS: INSTITUTIONS AND REFORM, Donovan, Smith, Mooney, and new co-author Tracy Osborn go beyond the purely descriptive treatment usually found in state and local texts. Offering an engaging comparative approach, the Fourth Edition shows you how politics and government differ between states and communities, and points out the causes and effects of those variations. The text also focuses on what social scientists know about the effects of rules and institutions on politics and policy. This comparative, institutional framework enables you to think more analytically about the impact of institutions on policy outcomes, asks you to evaluate the effectiveness of one institutional approach over another, and encourages you to consider more sophisticated solutions. Written by four young, high-profile specialists who have contributed significantly to the field in the last decade, STATE AND LOCAL POLITICS: INSTITUTIONS AND REFORM incorporates the most recent scholarship available into the course, giving you access to perspectives that no other textbook on the market currently provides.</p><p>Todd Donovan (Ph.D., University of California, Riverside) is a professor of Political Science at Western Washington University.

Of the many forms in which the Japanese architectural genius has expressed itself, probably none has more immediate appeal for the Westerner than these commoners&#39; dwellings in country and in town. Their functional beauty and quiet understatement reflect a tradition of design and craftsmanship that commands the admiration of professional architect and layman alike. In fact, modern architects, both Japanese and Western, have found in the minka a source of inspiration for new concepts of design and the effective use of space....[T]hey embody the ideals of Japanese domestic architecture in their most vital form. In a word, the minka is the essentiail Japanese house. In this engagingly written and generously illustrated book, the reader is introduced to the minka in all its significant aspects: its place in Japanese architectural history and in the social scene of the feudal age, its structural variety, its adaptation to environmental conditions, its role as a symbol of social status, and its functional and aesthetic values. At the same time, the book gives appropriate attention to the people who built these houses and lived in them - the farmers, the townsmen, the merchants, the lower-level government officials, the innkeepers, the less affluent samurai - and to the variations in structure and style determined by the occupations and preferences of the owners. Of particular interest is the wealth of detail in which the distinguishing features of the minka style are presented and discussed. The abundant photographs (19 in full color and well over 100 in black and white), drawings, and other illustrations cover the full range of achievement in the minka form during some three centuries.&#34;</p><p>Text: English, Japanese (translation)</p><h2>The Politically Incorrect Guide to Global Warming (and Environmentalism)</h2><p>Global warming":<br>the Left's last best chance to gain a stranglehold on our political system and economy<br> <br>For decades, environmentalism has been the Left's best excuse for increasing government control over our actions in ways both large and small. It's for Mother Earth! It's for the children! It's for the whales! But until now, the doomsday-scenario environmental scares they've trumped up haven't been large enough to justify the lifestyle restrictions they want to impose. With global warming, however, greenhouse gasbags can argue that auto emissions in Ohio threaten people in Paris, and that only "global governance" (Jacques Chirac's words) can tackle such problems.<br> <br>Now, in The Politically Incorrect Guide(tm) to Global Warming and Environmentalism, Christopher C. Horner tears the cover off the Left's manipulation of environmental issues for political purposes--and lays out incontrovertible evidence for the fact that catastrophic man-made global warming is just more Chicken-Little hysteria, not actual science. He explains why, although Al Gore and his cronies among the media elites and UN globalists endlessly bleat that "global warming" is an unprecedented global crisis, they really think of it as a dream come true. It's the ideal scare campaign for those who hate capitalism and love big government. For, as Horner explains, if global warming really were as bad as the Leftist doomsayers insist it is, then no policy imaginable could "solve" it. According to the logic of the greens' own numbers, no matter how much we sacrifice there would still be more to do. That makes global warming the bottomless well of excuses for the relentless growth of big government.<br> <br>Horner (an attorney and senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute) reveals the full anti-American, anti-capitalist, and anti-human agenda of today's environmentalists, dubbing them "green on the outside, red to the core." He details how they use strong-arm legal tactics--and worse--against those who dare to point out the weakness of their arguments for global warming. Along the way, he explodes ten top global warming myths, carefully examining the evidence to determine how much warming there really is and what is actually causing it. He exposes the lies that the environmental lobby routinely tells to make its case; the ways in which it is trying to impose initiatives such as the Kyoto Protocol on an unwilling American public; and much more--including the green lobby's favorite politicians (John Kerry, John McCain, Joe Lieberman, and others).<br> <br>It's time to stand up to the environmentalist industry and insist: human beings are not the enemy. In breezy, light-hearted, and always entertaining fashion, The Politically Incorrect Guide(tm) to Global Warming and Environmentalism gives you the facts you need to do so.</p><p>Christopher C. Horner is a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, an acknowledged expert on global warming legislation and regulation, and has spoken before Senate committees and the European Parliament.</p><h2>Roman Art: Romulus to Constantine</h2><p>Ideal for readers who are studying Roman art for the first time, this exceptionally well-illustrated volume explores Roman art in the traditional historical manner&#x20ac;&#x201d;with a focus on painting, sculpture, architecture, and minor arts.

By her use of rhyming couplets, Lois Burdett has once again succeeded in transforming Shakespeare's complex verse into a format readily understood by children. </p><p> Children's enthusiasm toward Burdett's adapted Shakespeare is evident in the wonderful drawings and anecdotes created by her Grade 2 and 3 students at Hamlet Elementary School in Stratford, Ontario. Together with the five other books in the successful and beautifully produced <i>Shakespeare Can Be Fun!</i> series, <b>The Tempest</b> will delight teachers, parents and children. </p></p><p><p><b> Shakespeare Can Be Fun! </b></p><p> Most students will be exposed to the works of Shakespeare, typically in high school. The language and content of the plays is seen as too difficult for younger children but primary children are underestimated as to what they can accomplish given the challenge. The study of Shakespeare has become an integral part of my grade two program at Hamlet School, in Stratford, Ontario, Canada. </p><p> When I first moved to Stratford, I had no intention of teaching Shakespeare to 7 and 8 year olds. Stratford is a beautiful city noted for its Shakespearean theatre and I was interested that the schools were all named after Shakespearean characters. I asked my class, "Who is William Shakespeare?" and "Why is our school called Hamlet?" Their answers were surprising. One thought he was a famous boxer. Another believed he was the President of Canada. A third student responded, "I don't know who William Shakespeare is. I don't know any of the big kids." It was the children's enthusiasm and excitement on making the connection between an historical figure and the name of their school, which led me to continue. Thirty years later I can't imagine teaching anywhere in the world and not introducing Shakespeare. The study provided tremendous growth, particularly in the area of language and communication and evolved into a learning experience of a lifetime. I have endeavored in my books and workshops for teachers to share the excitement of exploring with children, the timeless emotions and ideas of Shakespeare. </p><p> The comments of two of my children, written at various times in their daily journals show the lasting impression Shakespeare has had on them. </p><p> "Shakespeare is like a big piece of chocolate cake. Once you've started you wish you could go on and on forever, in a non-stopping dream." (Anika, age 7) </p><p> "William's incredible words are like a velvet silk coat that rap around his pure thoughts. His pen writes on like all colors of the wind." (Sean, age 7) </p><p> <b>Lois Burdett</b> is in great demand throughout North America and Europe for her workshops where she instructs educators how to familiarize young children with Shakespeare. Among other commendations, Lois Burdett has received <i>Encyclopedia Britannica's National Award for Early Childhood Education</i>, Canada's <i>Meritorious Service Medal</i>, the Canadian Teachers' Federation's <i>Hilroy Fellowship</i>, and two writers' awards. Burdett's many speaking engagements have included the International Reading Association and the National Council of Teachers of English. Her books, magazine articles, presentations and media interviews are testimony to her strong influence in the education community, where she has also been instrumental in helping teachers to incorporate Shakespeare into early grade curricula. </p></p><h2>Real Leadership: 9 Simple Practices for Leading and Living with Purpose</h2><p><p><strong>***A <em>Wall Street Journal</em>&nbsp;and <em>USA Today </em>bestseller***</strong></p><p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Leadership lessons for enduring business and personal success from renowned motivational speaker, current leadership editor of <i>Success </i>magazine and former co-CEO of Primerica, John Addison</strong></p><p></p><p>In <em>Real Leadership</em>, author John Addison shares his straightforward practices for successful leadership through his personal and professional journey, helping leaders at any level understand and emulate the nine principles that fostered enduring results on his path to success.</p><p>As co-CEO of Primerica--the largest independent financial services marketing organization in North America--from 1999 to 2015, Addison&nbsp; spearheaded the company through a period of rapid growth in the early 2000's, then helped navigate the company through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, and the separation from their parent company, Citibank, which created one of the most successful IPOs of the decade.</p><p>Guiding the organization through these monumental changes while also working to keep morale high, Addison developed a passion and talent for motivating others that allowed him to inspire and empower over a million people during his career.</p><p>The perspectives and personal laws of success that he&#x2019;s developed over decades of hard work and diligence boil down to the principles of living your best life.

Dunkle answers any query the beginner or expert might have on the subject of dragonfly-watching on this continent--what kind of binoculars to buy, where to start looking for dragonflies, how to photograph these striking creatures, which clubs or societies to join, and so forth. Other important features for this handy field guide include detailed accounts of every species mentioned, useful information on habitats, explanations of mating rituals, full-color photographs of most of the species described, and range maps.<br></p><p><br><strong>Sidney W. Dunkle</strong> is a professor at Collin County Community College in Texas.<br><br>"Dragonflies have been around for over 250 million years, and it's about time they got the recognition they deserve...Now that shortcoming has been rectified for the 307 North American species in <em>Dragonflies Through Binoculars,</em> a compact book full of information...[Sidney W. Dunkle] has succeeded admirably with this volume, which is sure to delight the ever-increasing ranks of dragonfly enthusiasts...The range maps alone are worth the price of the book...Buy this book and spend a sunny summer afternoon along the shore of a stream, pond, or lake; your life will be transformed." --<em> Dennis R.</em> <em>Paulson, Science</em><p></p><br>"This long anticipated field guide has filled one of the major identification gaps for the general naturalist in North America.... The species accounts...contain a wealth of previously unrecorded biological and field identification information."--<em>Audubon Naturalist News</em><p></p><br>"Until now...there has not been a good field guide for the dragonflies of North America. The new <em>Dragonflies through Binoculars</em> fills this need, and is sure to swell the ranks of those pursuing these fast-fliers.... The 47 color plates illustrate all but 14 of the 307 species of dragonflies found in North America....Each species has a very complete written account that provides extensive details on identification, comparisons with similar species, habitat notes, and information on seasonal occurrence.

In the dilemma of this increasingly paranoid hero, Dostoevsky makes vividly concrete the inner disintegration of consciousness that would become a major theme of his work.<br><i><br>The Gambler</i> was written twenty years later, under the pressure of crushing debt. It is a stunning psychological portrait of a young man&#x2019;s exhilarating and destructive addiction, a compulsion that Dostoevsky&#x2013;who once gambled away his young wife&#x2019;s wedding ring&#x2013;knew intimately from his own experience. In the disastrous love affairs and gambling adventures of his character, Alexei Ivanovich, Dostoevsky explores the irresistible temptation to look into the abyss of ultimate risk that he believed was an essential part of the Russian national character.<br><br>The two strikingly original short novels brought together here&#x2013;in new translations by award-winning translators&#x2013;were both literary gambles of a sort for Dostoevsky.<br><br></p></p><p>About the Translators: Richard Pevear has published translations of Alain, Yves Bonnefoy, Alberto Savinio, Pavel Florensky, and Henri Volohonsky, as well as two books of poetry. He has received fellowships or grants for translation from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Ingram Merrill Foundation, the Guggenheim Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the French Ministry of Culture. Larissa Volokhonsky was born in Leningrad. She has translated works by the prominent Orthodox theologians Alexander Schmemann and John Meyendorff into Russian. Together, Pevear and Volokhonsky have translated <i>Dead Souls and The Collected Tales</i> by Nikolai Gogol, <i>The Complete Short Novels of Chekhov</i>, and <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i>, <i>Crime and Punishment</i>, <i>Notes from Underground</i>, <i>Demons</i>, <i>The Idiot</i>, and <i>The Adolescent</i> by Fyodor Dostoevsky. They were awarded the PEN Book-of-the-Month Club Translation Prize for their version of <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i> and of Tolstoy's <i>Anna Karenina</i>, and their translation of Dostoevsky's<i> Demons</i> was one of three nominees for the same prize. They are married and live in France.CHAPTER IIt was nearly eight o&#39;clock in the morning when the titular councillor1 Yakov Petrovich Goliadkin came to after a long sleep, yawned, stretched, and finally opened his eyes all the way. For some two minutes, however, he lay motionless on his bed, like a man who is not fully certain whether he is awake or still asleep, whether what is happening around him now is a reality or a continuation of the disordered reveries of his sleep. Soon, though, Mr. Goliadkin&#39;s senses began to receive their usual everyday impressions more clearly and distinctly. The dirtyish green, sooty, and dusty walls of his little room, his mahogany chest of drawers, the imitation mahogany chairs, the red-painted table, the oilcloth Turkish sofa of a reddish color with little green flowers, and finally his clothes, hastily taken off the night before and thrown in a heap on the sofa, all gazed at him familiarly. Finally, the gray autumn day, dull and dirty, peeked into his room through the dim window so crossly and with such a sour grimace that Mr. Goliadkin could in no way doubt any longer that he was not in some far-off kingdom but in the city of Petersburg, in the capital, on Shestilavochnaya Street, on the fourth floor of a quite large tenement house, in his own apartment. Having made this important discovery, Mr. Goliadkin convulsively closed his eyes, as if regretting his recent dream and wishing to bring it back for a brief moment. But after a moment he leaped out of bed at a single bound, probably hitting finally upon the idea around which his scattered, not yet properly ordered thoughts had been turning. Having leaped out of bed, he ran at once to the small round mirror that stood on the chest of drawers. Though the sleepy, myopic, and rather bald-pated figure reflected in the mirror was precisely of such insignificant quality as to arrest decidedly no one&#39;s exclusive attention at first sight, its owner evidently remained perfectly pleased with all he saw in the mirror. &#39;&#39;What a thing it would be,&#39;&#39; Mr. Goliadkin said half-aloud, &#39;&#39;what a thing it would be if something was amiss with me today, if, for instance, something went wrong--a stray pimple popped out somehow or some other sort of unpleasantness occurred; however, so far it&#39;s not bad; so far everything&#39;s going well.&#39;&#39; Very glad that everything was going well, Mr. Goliadkin put the mirror back in its former place, and, despite the fact that he was barefoot and still wearing the costume in which he was accustomed to go to bed, he rushed to the window and, with great concern, began searching with his eyes for something in the courtyard on which the windows of his apartment gave. Apparently whatever he was searching for in the yard also satisfied him completely; his face lit up with a self-satisfied smile. Then--though not without having first peeked behind the partition into the closet of his valet Petrushka and made sure that Petrushka was not in it-- he tiptoed to the desk, unlocked one of the drawers, rummaged about in the hindmost corner of that drawer, finally took out a shabby green wallet from under some old yellow papers and trash, opened it warily, and peeked carefully and with delight into its remotest secret pocket. Probably a wad of green, gray, blue, red, and multicolored bits of paper looked back quite affably and approvingly at Mr. Goliadkin: with a beaming face he placed the opened wallet on the table before him and rubbed his hands energetically as a sign of the greatest pleasure. Finally he took it out, his comforting wad of banknotes, and for the hundredth time--that is, counting only from yesterday--began to re-count them, painstakingly rubbing each leaf between his thumb and index finger. &#39;&#39;Seven hundred and fifty roubles in banknotes!&#39;&#39; he finished finally in a half-whisper. &#39;&#39;Seven hundred and fifty roubles...a significant sum! An agreeable sum,&#39;&#39; he went on in a voice trembling and slightly faint with pleasure, squeezing the wad in his hands and smiling significantly, &#39;&#39;quite an agreeable sum! An agreeable sum for anyone! I&#39;d like to see the man now for whom this sum would be negligible! A man can go far on such a sum...&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;What is this, though?&#39;&#39; thought Mr. Goliadkin. &#39;&#39;Where is Petrushka?&#39;&#39; Still wearing the same costume, he peeked once more behind the partition. Again Petrushka was not to be found behind the partition; there was only a samovar left on the floor there, angry, excited, and beside itself, constantly threatening to run away, and babbling to Mr. Goliadkin heatedly, quickly, in its abstruse language, lisping and swallowing its R&#39;s--probably saying something like, &#39;&#39;Take me, good people, I&#39;m perfectly ripe and ready.&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;Devil take it!&#39;&#39; thought Mr. Goliadkin. &#39;&#39;The lazy brute may finally drive one beyond the last limits; where&#39;s he lolling about?&#39;&#39; In righteous indignation he went to the front hall, which consisted of a small corridor at the end of which was the door to the vestibule, opened that door a crack, and saw his servitor surrounded by a decent-sized crowd of sundry lackeyish, domestic, and accidental riffraff. Petrushka was telling some story, the others were listening. Apparently Mr. Goliadkin liked neither the subject of the conversation nor the conversation itself. He immediately called Petrushka and went back to his room thoroughly displeased, even upset. &#39;&#39;This brute is ready to sell a man for a groat, all the more so his master,&#39;&#39; he thought to himself, &#39;&#39;and he did, he surely did, I&#39;m ready to bet he sold me for a penny. Well, so?...&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;They&#39;ve brought the livery, sir.&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;Put it on and come here.&#39;&#39;Having put on the livery, Petrushka, smiling stupidly, went to his master&#39;s room. He could not have been more oddly costumed. He was wearing extremely shabby green lackey&#39;s livery with frazzled gold braid, apparently made for someone a whole two feet taller than Petrushka. In his hands he was holding a hat, also with braid and with green feathers, and at his hip he had a lackey&#39;s sword in a leather scabbard.Finally, to complete the picture, Petrushka, following his favorite habit of always going about casually, in home-style, was barefoot now as well. Mr. Goliadkin inspected Petrushka all around and apparently remained pleased. The livery had obviously been rented for some solemn occasion. It was also noticeable that during the inspection Petrushka looked at his master with some strange expectation, and followed his every movement with extraordinary curiosity, which greatly embarrassed Mr. Goliadkin.&#39;&#39;Well, and the carriage?&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;The carriage has come, too.&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;For the whole day?&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;For the whole day. Twenty-five, in banknotes.&#39;&#39;2&#39;&#39;And they&#39;ve brought the boots?&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;And they&#39;ve brought the boots.&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;Blockhead! Can&#39;t you say they&#39;ve brought them, sir? Bring them here.&#39;&#39;Having expressed his satisfaction that the boots fit well, Mr. Goliadkin asked for tea, a wash and a shave. He shaved rather painstakingly and washed in the same way, hastily sipped some tea, and proceeded to his main, definitive dressing: he put on almost perfectly new trousers; then a shirt front with little bronze buttons, a waistcoat with rather bright and agreeable little flowers; tied a multicolored silk cravat around his neck, and finally pulled on a uniform jacket, also spanking new and painstakingly brushed. While dressing, he glanced lovingly at his boots several times, lifted now one foot, now the other, admired the style, and kept whispering something under his nose, occasionally winking at his thoughts with an expressive little grimace. However, Mr. Goliadkin was extremely distracted that morning, because he let Petrushka&#39;s little smiles and grimaces on his account as he helped him dress go almost unnoticed. Finally, having adjusted everything properly, the fully dressed Mr. Goliadkin put his wallet in his pocket, definitively admired Petrushka, who had put on his boots and was thus in full readiness, and, noticing that everything had been done and there was nothing more to wait for, hastily, bustlingly, with little trepidations of the heart, ran down his stairs. A light blue hackney carriage with some coat-of-arms on it rolled up thunderingly to the porch. Petrushka, exchanging winks with the coachman and various idlers, seated his master in the carriage; in an unaccustomed voice and barely holding back his foolish laughter, he shouted: &#39;&#39;Gee-up!&#39;&#39; and jumped onto the tailboard, and the whole thing, with noise and thunder, jingling and clattering, rolled off towards Nevsky Prospect.3 The blue carriage had no sooner driven through the gate than Mr. Goliadkin rubbed his hands convulsively and dissolved into quiet, inaudible laughter, like a man of merry character who has managed to play a nice trick and is as glad of it as glad can be. However, immediately following this fit of merriment, the laughter on Mr. Goliadkin&#39;s face changed to a strangely preoccupied expression. Though the weather was damp and gray, he lowered both windows of the carriage and began looking concernedly to right and left at passersby, immediately assuming a decent and decorous air as soon as he noticed someone looking at him. At the turn from Liteinaya onto Nevsky, he gave a start from a most unpleasant sensation and, wincing like some poor fellow whose corn has accidentally been stepped on, hastily and even fearfully pressed himself into the darkest corner of the carriage. The thing was that he had met two of his colleagues, two young clerks from the department where he himself worked. The clerks, as it seemed to Mr. Goliadkin, were for their own part also extremely perplexed at meeting their colleague in this fashion; one of them even pointed his finger at Mr. Goliadkin. It even seemed to Mr. Goliadkin that the other called him loudly by name, which, naturally, was quite an improper thing to do in the street. Our hero stayed hidden and did not respond. &#39;&#39;Little brats!&#39;&#39; he began to reason with himself. &#39;&#39;Well, what&#39;s so strange? A man in a carriage; a man needs to be in a carriage, so he takes a carriage. Simply trash! I know them--they&#39;re simply brats who ought to be whipped! They only play pitch-and-toss on payday and mooch about somewhere, that&#39;s what they do. I could tell them all a thing or two, only...&#39;&#39; Mr. Goliadkin did not finish and went dead. A brisk pair of pretty Kazan horses, quite familiar to Mr. Goliadkin, hitched to a jaunty droshky, was quickly passing his carriage on the right. The gentleman sitting in the droshky, chancing to see the face of Mr. Goliadkin, who quite imprudently stuck his head out the window of the carriage, was apparently also extremely amazed at such an unexpected encounter and, leaning out as far as he could, began peering with great curiosity and concern into the corner of the carriage, where our hero had hastened to hide. The gentleman in the droshky was Andrei Filippovich, head of an office in the place where Mr. Goliadkin also served in the quality of assistant to his section chief. Mr. Goliadkin, seeing that Andrei Filippovich recognized him perfectly well, was looking at him all eyes, and it was simply impossible to hide from him, blushed to the roots of his hair. &#39;&#39;Should I bow or not? Should I respond or not? Should I acknowledge him or not?&#39;&#39; our hero thought in indescribable anguish. &#39;&#39;Or pretend it&#39;s not me but someone else strikingly resembling me, and look as if nothing has happened? Precisely not me, not me, and that&#39;s that!&#39;&#39; Mr. Goliadkin said, tipping his hat to Andrei Filippovich and not taking his eyes off him. &#39;&#39;I...I&#39;m all right,&#39;&#39; he whispered with effort, &#39;&#39;I&#39;m quite all right, it&#39;s not me at all, Andrei Filippovich, it&#39;s not me at all, not me, and that&#39;s that.&#39;&#39; Soon, however, the droshky passed the carriage, and the magnetism of the directorial gaze ceased. However, he still kept blushing, smiling, muttering something to himself... &#39;&#39;I was a fool not to respond,&#39;&#39; he thought finally, &#39;&#39;I should simply have taken a bold footing and said frankly, but not without nobility, &#39;Thus and so, Andrei Filippovich, I&#39;m also invited to dinner, and that&#39;s that!&#39; &#39;&#39; Then, suddenly remembering that he had fiunked it, our hero fiared up like fire, frowned, and cast a terrible, defiant glance into the front corner of the carriage, a glance intended to incinerate all his enemies to dust at a stroke. Finally, by some sudden inspiration, he pulled the cord tied to the coachman&#39;s elbow, stopped the carriage, and told the coachman to turn back to Liteinaya. The thing was that Mr. Goliadkin felt an immediate need, probably for the sake of his own peace of mind, to say something most interesting to his doctor, Krestyan Ivanovich. And though his acquaintance with Krestyan Ivanovich was quite recent-- namely, he had visited him only once the previous week, owing to a certain necessity--a doctor, as they say, is the same as a father confessor, to hide would be stupid, and to know the patient was his duty. &#39;&#39;Will all this be right, though?&#39;&#39; our hero went on, stepping out of the carriage by the entrance to a five-story house on Liteinaya where he had ordered his equipage to stop, &#39;&#39;will it all be right? Will it be decent? Will it be appropriate? So what, though,&#39;&#39; he went on, going up the stairs, trying to catch his breath and restrain the throbbing of his heart, which was in the habit of throbbing on other people&#39;s stairs, &#39;&#39;so what? It&#39;s my own affair, and there&#39;s nothing reprehensible in it...It would be stupid to hide. So I&#39;ll make believe that I&#39;m all right, and that I was just passing by...He&#39;ll see that it must be so.&#39;&#39;Reasoning thus, Mr. Goliadkin reached the second floor and stopped in front of apartment number five, on the door of which hung a beautiful brass plaque with the inscription:KRESTYAN IVANOVICH RUTENSPITZDOCTOR OF MEDICINE AND SURGERYStopping, our hero hastened to give his physiognomy a decent, casual air, not without a certain courtesy, and prepared to give the bell-pull a tug. Having prepared to give the bell-pull a tug, he immediately and rather appropriately reasoned that tomorrow would be better, and that now, for the time being, there was no great need. But, suddenly hearing someone&#39;s footsteps on the stairs, Mr. Goliadkin immediately changed his new resolve and, just by the way, though maintaining a most resolute air, rang at Krestyan Ivanovich&#39;s door.</p><h2>Practicing New Historicism</h2><p><p>For almost twenty years, new historicism has been a highly controversial and influential force in literary and cultural studies. In <i>Practicing the New Historicism,</i> two of its most distinguished practitioners reflect on its surprisingly disparate sources and far-reaching effects.<br> <br> In lucid and jargon-free prose, Catherine Gallagher and Stephen Greenblatt focus on five central aspects of new historicism: recurrent use of anecdotes, preoccupation with the nature of representations, fascination with the history of the body, sharp focus on neglected details, and skeptical analysis of ideology. Arguing that new historicism has always been more a passionately engaged practice of questioning and analysis than an abstract theory, Gallagher and Greenblatt demonstrate this practice in a series of characteristically dazzling readings of works ranging from paintings by Joos van Gent and Paolo Uccello to <i>Hamlet</i> and <i>Great Expectations.</i><br> <br> By juxtaposing analyses of Renaissance and nineteenth-century topics, the authors uncover a number of unexpected contrasts and connections between the two periods. Are aspects of the dispute over the Roman Catholic doctrine of the Eucharist detectable in British political economists' hostility to the potato? How does Pip's isolation in <i>Great Expectations</i> shed light on Hamlet's doubt?<br> <br> Offering not only an insider's view of new historicism, but also a lively dialogue between a Renaissance scholar and a Victorianist, <i>Practicing the New Historicism</i> is an illuminating and unpredictable performance by two of America's most respected literary scholars.<br> <br> "Gallagher and Greenblatt offer a brilliant introduction to new historicism. In their hands, difficult ideas become coherent and accessible."&#x2014;<i>Choice</i><br> <br> "A tour de force of new literary criticism. . . . Gallagher and Greenblatt's virtuoso readings of paintings, potatoes (yes, spuds), religious ritual, and novels&#x2014;all 'texts'&#x2014;as well as essays on criticism and the significance of anecdotes, are likely to take their place as model examples of the qualities of the new critical school that they lead. . . . A zesty work for those already initiated into the incestuous world of contemporary literary criticism-and for those who might like to see what all the fuss is about."&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>, starred review</p></p><p>"Gallagher and Greenblatt offer a brilliant introduction to new historicism.

S. Mann, dean of the&nbsp;&nbsp;Ecumenical Institute Theology, St. Mary's Seminary&nbsp;&nbsp;and University,&nbsp;&nbsp;Baltimore.<br><br><i>Matthew</i> is the most familiar of the&nbsp;&nbsp;gospels, best known for its parables, miracle&nbsp;&nbsp;narratives, and the long Sermon on the Mount. Recognized&nbsp;&nbsp;by the early Church as the most fitting&nbsp;&nbsp;introduction to the New Testament, its special concern is to&nbsp;&nbsp;announce Jesus as the fulfillment of the 0ld&nbsp;&nbsp;Testament. Hence its emphasis on the Law, on ethics&nbsp;&nbsp;based on the traditional theology of the Covenant,&nbsp;&nbsp;and on the centrality of Messianic&nbsp;&nbsp;hope.<br><br>This commentary sets the understanding of&nbsp;&nbsp;Matthew in the context of its author's own religious&nbsp;&nbsp;and secular background. Believing that the text&nbsp;&nbsp;should be approached directly, the writers of the&nbsp;&nbsp;commentary make constant use of the recently&nbsp;&nbsp;discovered historical and linguistic evidence now&nbsp;&nbsp;available to elucidate it. This approach results in&nbsp;&nbsp;placing Jesus firmly within the framework of&nbsp;&nbsp;ascertainable Jewish tradition in first-century&nbsp;&nbsp;Palestine.<br><br>The writers hold that the claim of&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus to fulfill the Law and not to abolish it must&nbsp;&nbsp;be taken seriously. They have therefore taken a&nbsp;&nbsp;fresh look at the legal discussions in&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Matthew</i>. In the light of their&nbsp;&nbsp;examination, there emerges first a revaluation of the meaning&nbsp;&nbsp;attached to such key words as "parables"&nbsp;&nbsp;and "hypocrite" and then a new and vital&nbsp;&nbsp;significance for such words.<br><br>The&nbsp;&nbsp;result is a new respect for&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Matthew</i>, a highly reliable early source for the ministry&nbsp;&nbsp;of Jesus, and an examination of that ministry&nbsp;&nbsp;uncluttered by the presuppositions of various forms of&nbsp;&nbsp;modern "Platonism."</p><p></p><h2>On Course, Study Skills Plus Edition (Textbook-specific CSFI)</h2><p>ON COURSE: STRATEGIES FOR CREATING SUCCESS IN COLLEGE AND IN LIFE, STUDY SKILLS PLUS EDITION will engage you with the tools you need to take charge of your success in college and in life.

Dr. Downing has earned degrees from Princeton University, Johns Hopkins University, the University of Santa Monica, and Carnegie Mellon University. He holds advanced degrees in both English and counseling psychology. He was professor of English at Baltimore City Community College (BCCC) for 32 years. In addition to his role as an academic instructor, Dr. Downing created and coordinated BCCC&#39;s Student Success and Learning Community Programs. These programs teach students how to apply proven success strategies to achieve their full potential in college and in life. The College Success Program resulted in a significant increase in both student academic success and retention. Dr. Downing has made numerous presentations at national conferences and conducted faculty development workshops at many two- and four-year colleges and universities in the United States, Canada, Bermuda, and the Virgin Islands. Dr. Downing&#39;s teaching, writing, and consulting are all guided by his belief that the greatest mission of any educational institution is to empower its students to live rich, fulfilling lives. Since 1996, he has facilitated the On Course Workshops, intensive four-day retreats for college educators focusing on proven strategies for helping students become active, responsible partners in their education and achieve greater success in college and in life."My first impression is that the new study skills coverage will be a welcome addition to the current text. I think they help to tie together critical pieces to the success puzzle that takes a distinct shape for each individual."<br><br>"I love the On Course book but have felt that the student's need for enhanced study skills was missing. I would now teach the class as Skip had originated the text but show students how their motivation and responsibility ties in with the additional study skills portion."<br><br>"I am thrilled with the CORE Learning Process and integration into the "Wise Choices" sections. As I read through the first section I was excited about it, and by the 3rd chapter I was ecstatic - it's integrated very well with the material from the rest of the chapter and the book as a whole. I really like when material from the chapter the student has just read becomes part of the examples within the "Wise Choice" section. In the past I had a hard time getting my students to try out the ideas found in the current study skills sections of On Course and therefore I needed to create an additional project for them to apply the strategies. Now I can see how these sections will allow them to engage and apply skills each week along with their reading."<br><br>"I love the CORE learning process. I think it adds depth to the text. I believe the integration is thorough and these will be very effective tools. I have always loved the On Course material and never thought it was lacking, but reviewing this material makes me want the new edition now. The additions are insightful improvements which show Skip knows what we need as educators before some of us realize we need it."<br><br>"I think that the CORE Learning Process is an exceptional way to enable students to organize their materials. Most students utilize one or two of the process, but in no semblance of order and with no idea of how or why they are doing it. This is definitely an effective tool as it allows the student to work within a logical pattern of gathering, managing, reviewing and assessing their materials."</p><h2>The Myth of Martyrdom: What Really Drives Suicide Bombers, Rampage Shooters, and Other Self-Destructive Killers</h2><p>For decades, experts have told us that suicide bombers are the psychological equivalent of America's Navy SEALs--men and women so fully committed to their cause or faith that they cease to fear death. In <i>The Myth of Martyrdom</i>, Adam Lankford corrects this misconception, arguing that terrorists are driven to suicide for the same reasons any civilian might be: depression, anxiety, marital strife, or professional failure. He takes readers on a journey through the minds of suicide bombers, airplane hijackers, 'lone wolf' terrorists, and rampage shooters, via their suicide notes, love letters, diary entries, and martyrdom videos. The result is an astonishing account of rage and shame that will transform the way we think of terrorism forever. Lankford convincingly demonstrates that only by understanding the psychological crises that precipitate these acts can we ever hope to stop them.</p><p>Adam Lankford is a criminal justice professor at The University of Alabama.&nbsp;He has written for <i> The New York Times, Foreign Policy, Wired, The Daily Beast, The Huffington Post,</i> and numerous peer-reviewed journals. His research has been featured by CNN, MSNBC, NPR, BBC World Radio, CBS Radio, <i> The Boston Globe</i>, and many other national and international outlets.&nbsp;From 2003 to 2008, Lankford helped coordinate anti-terrorism efforts in conjunction with the U.S. State Department's Anti-Terrorism Assistance program. He lives in Tuscaloosa, Alabama."A lively, insightful, and evidence-based analysis of the most disruptive phenomenon in world affairs today. Adam Lankford challenges the conventional wisdom about suicide terrorism in a way that respects the facts, resolves the paradox (with profound implications for many other issues), and not least, de-romanticizes this loathsome practice." --<b>Steven Pinker, Harvard College Professor of Psychology, Harvard University, and author of <i>The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined</i></b><br><br>"A coherent, must read for all who would claim to be experts in terrorism--or just curious. Dr. Lankford's analytic rigor and willingness to examine assumptions make this a textbook example of how to do research and analysis...As Keynes once wrote: 'When someone persuades me I am wrong, I change my mind.' What will you do?"&nbsp;<b>--Jim Simon, former Asst. Director of Central Intelligence for Administration, Office of the Director of Central Intelligence, and Chair, Homeland Security Intelligence Council </b><br><br>"At last an insightful book about martyrdom and suicide bombers. Too many so-called experts have dominated the stage without ever examining the life of a suicide bomber. Lankford, in a thorough and in-depth study, has identified the trauma, chronic depression and suicidal behavior that characterize their lives. This is a fascinating book with profound implications." <b>--David Lester, former president of the International Association for Suicide Prevention</b><br><br>"Lankford demonstrates that suicide-murderers who call themselves martyrs are actually suicidal. Like many important ideas, this one seems utterly obvious once someone presents the overwhelming evidence and makes the compelling argument. As Lankford shows, terrorists are motivated by a lot more than the ideologies they espouse...A critically important contribution to the literature and, one hopes, to our counter-terrorism." <b>--Jessica Stern, former Director of Russian Affairs, National Security Council, and author of <i>Terror in the Name of God: Why Religious Militants Kill</i></b><br><br>"More than a decade after the 9/11 attack, scholars and commentators are still offering alternative explanations as to why the plotters were willing to commit suicide...In a must-read book for those interested in these issues...[Lankford] provides a benchmark that others will have to consider as they seek to reach their own conclusions." <b>--Donald Daniel, security studies professor, Georgetown University, and former Special Adviser to the Chairman, National Intelligence Council</b><br><br> <p>"Are suicide bombers psychologically normal? Many psychologists, including experts 'diagnosing' the hijackers responsible for the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks, view them as just that, albeit exercised by a powerful sense of justice. Adam Lankford begs to differ. Self-destructive killers, he says, are already primed for suicide &#x2014; so depressed, addicted or brutalized that it is relatively easy to tip them over the edge. A criminal-justice specialist, Lankford presents compelling, well-synthesized evidence for his case."--<em>Nature</em></p> <p>&#x201c;Lankford builds an impressive case ... If the courage assumed of suicide terrorism is its most powerful weapon, we can disarm this threat by denying its practitioners the myth of martyrdom.&#x201d;&#x2014;<em>Scientific American</em></p> <p>"A fierce attack on the view that suicide terrorists are true martyrs to a cause, worthy of respect or honor because of their commitment."--<em>Kirkus Reviews</em></p> <em></em> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p></p><h2>The Gloriously Gluten-Free Cookbook: Spicing Up Life with Italian, Asian, and Mexican Recipes</h2><p>Thrilling recipes from around the world that prove you can give up the gluten without giving up the flavor <p></p><p>For sufferers of celiac disease, the necessary diet limitations can seem like a culinary curse.

Conflicting ideas of religion, family and gender are explored as Salisbury follows Perpetua from her youth in a wealthy Roman household to her imprisonment and death in the arena.</p><p><strong>Joyce E. Salisbury</strong> holds the Frankenthal Professorship of Medieval History and Humanities at the University of Wisconsin, Green Bay. She is widely published in the fields of religion and medieval studies, and her most recent books include <em>The Beast Within: Animals and</em> <em>Bestiality in the Middle Ages</em> (Routledge, 1994) and <em>Church Fathers, Independent Virgins</em> (1992).An insightful, moving account of the death of an early-third- century Christian martyr, based on her own diary. Vibia Perpetua was the daughter of an old respected Roman family of Carthage and, although raised in accordance with the pagan religious traditions of Rome, converted to Christianity, one of many faiths competing for devotees in the Roman Empire. Just 22 years old, she was arrested with several other converts to Christianity and, because she refused to acknowledge the divinity of the emperor Septimus Severus (and even though she was the mother of an infant), was sentenced to be killed by beasts in the Carthaginian arena. Salisbury (Medieval History and Humanities/Univ. of Wisconsin, Green Bay) uses the text of Perpetua's diary, written in prison, to explore this extraordinary young woman's decision to renounce her prosperous life and embrace a horrible death, and to depict in vivid and fascinating detail the world of pagan Rome and the insular community of the early Church, with its emphasis on prophecy and speaking in tongues. Salisbury notes the contrast between the Roman religion, with its thousands of household gods, and monotheistic/trinitarian Christianity with its claim to be the only universally true religion. Also, the patriarchy of traditional Roman society, which restricted women to the roles of wife and mother, stood in stark contrast with the egalitarian promise of Christianity, which taught that all persons were equal before God and often gave women a leading role. Using Perpetua's text, Salisbury shows that, despite the dangers, the young woman turned her back on her affectionate family and infant son to become a Christian because of her profound conviction that she was experiencing the presence of God. A uniquely absorbing and poignant study of the vanished world of the early martyrs. (11 illustrations, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

There, abundant produce and other Mediterranean ingredients lend themselves particularly well to canning, bottling, and other preserving methods. Think of marinated artichokes in olive oil, classic <i>giardiniera</i>, or, of course, the late-summer tradition of putting up tomato sauce. But in this book we get so much more, from Marchetti&#x2019;s in-person travels across the regions of Italy as well as the recipes handed down through her family: sweet and sour peppers, Marsala-spiked apricot jam, lemon-infused olive oil, and her grandmother&#x2019;s <i>amarene</i>, sour cherries preserved in alcohol. Beyond canning and pickling, the book also includes recipes for making cheese, curing meats, infusing liqueurs, and even a few confections, plus recipes for finished dishes so you can savor each treasured jar all year long.<br>&nbsp;<br></p><p>A former newspaper reporter, DOMENICA MARCHETTI is the author of six cookbooks on Italian cooking, including <i>Ciao Biscotti</i> and <i>The Glorious Pasta of Italy</i>. Her articles and recipes have been featured in <i>The Washington Post</i>, <i>Food &amp; Wine</i>, <i>Fine Cooking</i>, and <i>Cooking Light</i>, and on Leite's Culinaria and NPR.org's Kitchen Window, among others."In summer, books about canning and preserving are as common as apple cookbooks in the fall. But Domenica Marchetti&#x2019;s book caught my eye for its uncommon point of view: preserving food the Italian way. Pack artichokes, peppers and mushrooms in oil. Make deliciously spicy pickles from melon. Even <i>limoncello</i>, <i>mostarda</i> and confections like <i>torrone</i> can come straight from your kitchen...&nbsp;<b>The techniques may have been passed down by generations of <i>nonnas</i>, but they knew what they were doing</b>." -- Florence Fabricant for&nbsp;<i>The New York Times</i><br><br> "Marchetti elevates preserved food from the role of condiment to center stage." --<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br> "<i>Bellissima e deliziosa</i>, this book should be in every home preserver's kitchen. Peppered with stories and profiles, it introduces the reader to the world of Italian preserved foods well beyond the classic <i>giardiniera</i>, with chapters devoted to preserves in vinegar and in oil, fruits like peaches spiked with grappa, and plenty more." <b>--Cathy Barrow, author of <i>Mrs. Wheelbarrow's Practical Pantry</i></b><br><br> "Preserving Italy is now <i>the</i> book I recommend when asked about techniques like preserving in oil and how to make true mostardas. It should be a mandatory addition to preservation libraries everywhere." <b>--Marisa McClellan, author of <i>Food in Jars</i></b><br><br> "If you think 'preserve' is just another word for sweet fruit jam, think again. Domenica Marchetti explores the whole magnificent variety of traditional Italian preserves: a delicious plethora of jams and jellies, sausages and preserved meats (think pancetta and guanciale), sweet and tart drinks like limoncello and orzata, vinegar pickles, olive oil pickles--everything an Italian <i>casalinga</i>, like Marchetti's own grandmother, counts on to supply friends and family with an ongoing parade of delights. I can't wait to make sweet-and-sour peppers, then pile them on a crostino with some fresh mozzarella." <b>--Nancy Harmon Jenkins, author of <i>Virgin Territory</i> and, with daughter Sara, <i>The Four Seasons of Pasta</i></b><br><br> "The produce of Italy is inspiring and delicious, but, sadly, seasonal ingredients come but once a year. Unless, of course, you have this book at hand. Domenica's engagingly informative book explores, explains, and celebrates the age-old art of preserving seasonal goodness for the entire year." <b>--Elizabeth Minchilli, author of <i>Eating Rome</i></b><br><br> "Just when everyone thought all had been written about Italy's food, Domenica Marchetti brings us a collection of sweeping scope that teaches us how to make everything that can be put up, cured, or fermented. It is not every day that a cookbook comes along that is not only beautiful and evocative, but groundbreaking; <i>Preserving Italy</i> is such a book. Domenica is a terrific storyteller and a trustworthy guide to the marvels of the Italian pantry." <b>--Julia della Croce, journalist and author of <i>Italian Home Cooking</i></b></p><h2>A Rose Remembered (Secret of the Rose #2)</h2><p>Working with the Jewish underground at the onset of the Cold War, the baron&#39;s daughter, Sabina, begins a quest for her missing father while hiding from a man she almost married.</p><p><p>Berlin, 1961 </p><p> Karin Duftblatt walks the streets of Berlin on a secret mission.

Scholars generally hold one of three perspectives on the timing of and circumstances surrounding the rapture, all of which are presented in Three Views on the Rapture. The recent prominence of a Pre-Wrath understanding of the rapture calls for a fresh examination of this important but contested Christian belief. Alan D. Hultberg (PhD, Trinity International University and professor of New Testament at Talbot School of Theology) explains the Pre-Wrath view; Craig Blaising (PhD, Dallas Theological Seminary and president of Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary) defends the Pre-Tribulation view; and Douglas Moo (PhD, University of St. Andrews and professor of New Testament at Wheaton College) sets forth the Post-Tribulation view. Each author provides a substantive explanation of his position, which is critiqued by the other two authors. A thorough introduction gives a historical overview of the doctrine of the rapture and its effects on the church. The interactive and fair-minded format of the Counterpoints series allows readers to consider the strengths and weaknesses of each view and draw informed, personal conclusions.</p></p><p>Craig Blaising is Executive Vice President &amp; Provost and Professor of Theology at the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary.

It will describe the value they can bring to their organization and to primary leaders when they are serving at their full potential. It will reshape the way they view their role, with an emphasis on their own responsibility as leaders. It recognizes the unique challenges and frustrations of serving in a subordinate position and equips these leaders with the attitudes and skills that they will need to survive and thrive in this new paradigm. <p>Because of the scarcity of resources for second chair leaders, particularly those in the church, this book will offer a practical way to improve the performance of any organization. Leading Congregational Change discussed the importance of a "vision community"--a diverse group of key members who discern and implement the vision for a congregation--to guide the transformation of a church. This work will extend the theme of an empowered leadership team as we explore how individual clergy and laity can lead effectively.</p></p><p><p><b>Find Out How to Lead Effectively&#x2015; Even When You're Not in Charge</b> </p><p>"Somebody said the hardest instrument to play is second fiddle.

How can they lead effectively while serving under someone else's leadership? </p><p><i>Leading from the Second Chair</i> offers an invaluable resource to leaders who serve in second (and third and fourth) chair roles, enabling them to become more productive, proactive, and fulfilled. The book reveals the paradoxes of second chair leadership. These leaders must be subordinate to the top leader yet lead in their own right. They should be deep in their expertise but wide in perspective. And they must be content in their jobs yet remain enthusiastic about their dreams for the future. </p><p>Mike Bonem and Roger Patterson share their own and others' experiences of failure and success in this vital role. They offer support and practical advice for reshaping the way second chair leaders can serve well and improve the overall performance of their church or organization. </p><p><i>Leading from the Second Chair</i> equips readers with the positive attitudes, skills, and strategies needed to become powerful leaders who will survive and thrive in God's service. </p><p>Visit the Leadership Network Website, www.leadnet.org, for more innovative resources and information.</p></p><h2>Studies in Classic American Literature</h2><p>There is a half a sticker on the front cover a black mark on the bottom of the edge of the book</p><p>Studies in Classic American Literature, first published in 1923 and long out of print, provides a cross-section of Lawrence&#39;s writing on American literature, including landmark essays on Benjamin Franklin, Fenimore Cooper, Edgar Allan Poe, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville and Walt Whitman. This volume offers the final 1923 version of the text in a newly corrected and uncensored form, as well as earlier, often very different, versions of many of the essays, and a host of other materials, including four different versions of Lawrence&#39;s pioneering essay on Whitman.<b>D.H. Lawrence</b> (1885-1930), English novelist, storywriter, critic, poet and painter, one of the greatest figures in 20th-century English literature. Among his works, <i>Sons and Lovers</i> appeared in 1913, <i>The Rainbow</i> in 1915, <i>Women In Love</i> in 1920, and many others.</p><h2>The First World War: Volume I: To Arms</h2><p>This is the first truly definitive history of World War I, the war that has had the greatest impact on the course of the twentieth century. The first generation of its historians had access to a limited range of sources, and they focused primarily on military events. More recent approaches have embraced cultural, diplomatic, economic, and social history. In this authoritative and readable history, Hew Strachan combines these perspectives with a military and strategic narrative. The result is an account that breaks the bounds of national preoccupations to become both global and comparative.<br> The first of three volumes in this magisterial study, <em>To Arms</em> examines not only the causes of the war and its opening clashes on land and sea, but also the ideas that underpinned it, and the motivations of the people who supported it. It provides pioneering accounts of the war's finances, the war in Africa, and the Central Powers' bid to widen the war outside Europe.</p><p><br><strong>Hew Strachan</strong> is Professor of Modern History at the University of Glasgow. He is also Director of the Scottish Center for War Studies and Life Fellow of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge.<br><br>"Deserves to rank as one of the most impressive books of modern history in a generation. It reflects 20 years of research, and mastery of the literature of many nations....The book addresses every aspect of global conflict--diplomacy, politics, finance, industry, battle on land and at sea, in Europe, Africa, and around the world.....Magnificent."--<em>The London Evening Standard</em><p></p><br>"A towering achievement of protracted and painstaking scholarship. Strachan has read--and read closely--a daunting amount of the literature in English, French, and German. His knowledge is encyclopedic on everything from high finance to high explosives."--<em>The New York Review of Books</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Passing: a novel</h2><p>Originally published in 1929, Passing tells the troublesome relationship between two African-American woman who are light enough to pass for white. Irene Redfield marries an African-American doctor and moves to Harlem. Clare Kendy, on the other hand, marries a bigoted white man -- never telling him of her true heritage. When the two women meet, after decades of separation, they impact each other lives in ways that neither would have imagined.</p><p>The heroine of <i>Passing</i> takes an elevator from the infernal August Chicago streets to the breezy rooftop of the heavenly Drayton Hotel, "wafted upward on a magic carpet to another world, pleasant, quiet, and strangely remote from the sizzling one that she had left below." Irene is black, but like her author, the Danish-African American Nella Larsen (a star of the 1920s to mid-1930s Harlem Renaissance and the first black woman to win a Guggenheim creative-writing award), she can "pass" in white society. Yet one woman in the tea room, "fair and golden, like a sunlit day," keeps staring at her, and eventually introduces herself as Irene's childhood friend Clare, who left their hometown 12 years before when her father died. Clare's father had been born "on the left hand"--he was the product of a legal marriage between a white man and a black woman and therefore cut off from his inheritance. So she was raised penniless by white racist relatives, and now she passes as white. Even Clare's violent white husband is in the dark about her past, though he teases her about her tan and affectionately calls her "Nig." He laughingly explains: "When we were first married, she was white as--as--well as white as a lily. But I declare she's getting darker and darker." As Larsen makes clear, <i>Passing</i> can also mean dying, and Clare is in peril of losing her identity and her life. <p> The tale is simple on the surface--a few adventures in Chicago and New York's high life, with lots of real people and race-mixing events described (explicated by Thadious M. Davis's helpful introduction and footnotes). But underneath, it seethes with rage, guilt, sex, and complex deceptions. Irene fears losing her black husband to Clare, who seems increasingly predatory. Or is this all in Irene's mind? And is everyone wearing a mask? Larsen's book is a scary hall of mirrors, a murder mystery that can't resolve itself. It sticks with you. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>First published to critical acclaim in 1929, Passing firmly established Nella Larsen's prominence among women writers of the Harlem Renaissance. The Modern Library is proud to present Passing?an electrifying story of two women who cross the color line in 1920s New York?together with a new Introduction by the Obie Award- winning playwright and novelist Ntozake Shange. <br> <br>Irene Redfield, the novel's protagonist, is a woman with an enviable life. She and her husband, Brian, a prominent physician, share a comfortable Harlem town house with their sons. Her work arranging charity balls that gather Harlem's elite creates a sense of purpose and respectability for Irene. But her hold on this world begins to slip the day she encounters Clare Kendry, a childhood friend with whom she had lost touch. Clare?light-skinned, beautiful, and charming?tells Irene how, after her father's death, she left behind the black neighborhood of her adolescence and began passing for white, hiding her true identity from everyone, including her racist husband. As Clare begins inserting herself into Irene's life, Irene is thrown into a panic, terrified of the consequences of Clare's dangerous behavior. And when Clare witnesses the vibrancy and energy of the community she left behind, her burning desire to come back threatens to shatter her careful deception. <br> <br>Brilliantly plotted and elegantly written, Passing offers a gripping psychological portrait of emotional extremity. The New York Times Book Review called Larsen "adroit at tracing the involved processes of a mind divided against itself, that fights between the dictates of reason and desire." The Saturday Review of Literature said, "[Larsen] has produced a work so fine, sensitive, and distinguished that it rises above race categories and becomes that rare object, a good novel." <br></p><h2>Basic Inorganic Chemistry, 3rd Edition</h2><p>Explains the basics of inorganic chemistry with a primary emphasis on facts; then uses the student&#39;s growing factual knowledge as a foundation for discussing the important principles of periodicity in structure, bonding and reactivity.

In this excellent book, David Nichtern demonstrates that you can integrate all of them into one holistic life, guiding us through <i>ikigai</i> principles of do what you love, do what you are good at, do what the world wants, and do what the world is willing to pay for. I have always enjoyed David&#x2019;s music.

As I gained a self and success I realized that none of us live simple lives. We ALL need help to understand that a modern life demands flexibility and freedom. David&#x2019;s new book gives us guidance and the tools to do so but mostly permission to be ambitious <i>and</i> still.&#x201d; -- Jamie Lee Curtis<br><br>&#x201c;David Nichtern wonderfully shares the fruit of a long career and a wide variety of life experiences, along with his devoted meditation practice and exploration. Sound, tested, business planning and advice would seem to be an odd pairing with Buddhist teaching and guidance on how to establish a meditation practice. But <i>Creativity, Spirituality, and Making a Buck</i> proves this not to be the case.

David Nichtern figured out how to harmonize two essential modern human agendas.

We spare little thought for the great ideals that once gave life meaning and worth. <i>Self and Soul</i> is an impassioned effort to defend the values of the Soul.</p><p>Edmundson guides readers back to the ancient sources of the three great ideals: courage, contemplation, and compassion. Homer&#x2019;s <i>Iliad</i> presents two contrasting versions of the heroic ideal: Achilles, who risks everything to become the greatest of warriors, and Hector, who sacrifices his life to defend his people. Plato&#x2019;s quest is for timeless truth: he is the prime example of the authentic thinker, concentrating the ideal of contemplation. The third great ideal, compassion, is embodied by Jesus, the Buddha, and Confucius, who taught loving kindness, forgiveness, and forbearance in a world where such qualities are difficult and sometimes dangerous to espouse.</p><p>Shakespeare and Freud are the modern world&#x2019;s great enemies of these ideals, Edmundson argues. Shakespeare detests chivalry and has little time for faith and philosophy. Freud sees ideals as illusions that will inevitably betray us. But between them, a new ideal arises: imaginative creation, exemplified by Blake and Shelley.</p><p><i>Self and Soul </i>is, as Edmundson provocatively writes, an attempt to resurrect Soul in the modern world.</p></p><p>Mark Edmundson is University Professor at the University of Virginia.&#x201c;An impassioned critique of Western society, a relentless assault on contemporary complacency, shallowness, competitiveness, and self-regard... Throughout <i>Self and Soul</i>, Edmundson writes with a Thoreau-like incisiveness and fervor...

[It] quietly sets out to challenge many educational pieties, most of the assumptions of recent literary studies&#x2015;and his own chosen lifestyle.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Mathew Reisz</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Higher Education</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Edmundson&#x2019;s essays are smart and to the point, and there are some very good turns, as when he lists all the positive things that come from a life devoted to contemplating the ideal... Edmundson delivers a welcome championing of humanistic ways of thinking and living.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;There are few writers whom I turn to more eagerly than Mark Edmundson, one of our most perceptive voices on the subjects of teaching, learning, the humanities, and the conduct of a meaningful life. Edmundson believes, against the tide of the culture, that there is something more to existence than getting and spending (i.e., living half-awake for as long as possible), and in <i>Self and Soul</i> he shows us what that something might be. He is an idealist in an age of cynicism, a thinker in an age of surfaces. You won&#x2019;t regret a minute that you spend in his company.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>William Deresiewicz, author of <i>Excellent Sheep: The Miseducation of the American Elite and the Way to a Meaningful Life</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Self and Soul</i> is a series of secular hymns to the soul-saving idealists who shaped Western literature and spiritual philosophy&#x2015;from Homer to Shakespeare and Blake, Jesus to Emerson and Freud. Let Mark Edmundson be your guide to these wise ones, and whether you thought you knew them well, or have scarcely made their acquaintance, you will be revivified through his telling of a quest for salvation in classic texts that enshrine a trinity of ideals now under threat: courage, compassion, and contemplation.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Megan Marshall, author of <i>Margaret Fuller: A New American Life</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Mark Edmundson&#x2019;s <i>Self and Soul: A Defense of Ideals</i> is in every way a wonderful and highly original book.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>J. Hillis Miller, author of <i>Communities in Fiction</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;With this book Edmundson takes his place as one of the really remarkable contemporary cultural critics. The book, which is written with Edmundson&#x2019;s incredible lucidity and incisiveness, is really about its title: about what ideals mean and how they work. Ideals that inspire rather than humiliate; that intrigue rather than persecute.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Adam Phillips, author of <i>On Kissing, Tickling, and Being Bored</i></b></p><h2>Governmental and Nonprofit Accounting</h2><p><p> <i>For courses in governmental and nonprofit accounting. </i> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <b>A practice-approach that prepares you for professional government and nonprofit accounting</b> </p> <p>Written through the eyes of the learner, <b> <i>Governmental and Nonprofit Accounting</i> </b> prepares you for professional government, not-�for-�profit accounting practice, and the CPA exam.

These include an elderly retired merchant called Old Goriot, who has bankrupted himself for the sake of his two rapacious, social-climbing daughters, Delphine and Anastasie; a mysterious and sinister conspirator named Vautrin; Victorine, a disinherited heiress; and a naive and impoverished law student from the country,&nbsp;Eug�ne de Rastignac.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Rastignac is appalled at first by the greed and corruption he finds in Paris, but he soon sets his sights on conquering high society.

The sprawling, vibrant, and turbulent Paris of the post-Napoleonic era is itself a major character in the novel, an emblem of the social upheaval that Balzac portrays so brilliantly. <i>Old Goriot </i>was the first of Balzac&#x2019;s novels to employ his famous technique of recurring characters, and it has come to be seen as the keystone in his grand project, <i>The Human Comedy</i>.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Part II describes the five core leadership behavior patterns (supportiveness, directiveness, participation, reward/punishment, and charismatic behavior). Part III examines less-researched leader behavior patterns such as boundary-spanning, building social exchanges, and followership. Part IV describes the current leadership issues of ethics, diversity, leadership development, and change, with a concluding chapter that integrates findings from earlier chapters and describes popular leadership styles that are combinations of the specific leader behaviors described earlier. <b> </b> For leadership roles found in business, nursing, military science, criminal justice, education, government or agriculture.</p></p><p><p><b>Preface</b></p> <p> The basic premise of this book is <i>we know our leaders by what they do.</i> Leaders demonstrate their competence by setting worthwhile and challenging goals with followers, by showing confidence in followers and supporting their efforts to perform well and to improve themselves, and by giving recognition to followers when they do a job well. We expect our leaders to perform these and other important leadership behaviors. We may also expect leaders to be intelligent, visionary, inspirational, ethical, fair, and self-confident but we only perceive these personal characteristics by observing and experiencing a leader's behavior. When leaders successfully carry out these behaviors and produce favorable results for their groups and organizations, we view these leaders as effective. </p> <p> We have been teaching leadership in universities and colleges for over 20 years. We have used existing leadership textbooks as well as academic and popular articles that describe current theories and approaches about what it takes to be an effective leader. Our intent was to convey to our students the richness and breadth of knowledge about leadership that has accumulated during the twentieth century. We finally ' realized, however, that this approach left most students confused and frustrated. There were simply too many theories and approaches to leadership for most undergraduates (and many MBA students) to absorb and use. They often became lost in the mass of leadership theories and research presented in existing leadership textbooks. By the end of the course, they usually had no idea when or if a given theory was appropriate and often "latched on" to an overly simplistic and poorly supported model of leadership because it was simple enough for them to understand and remember. </p> <p> We have not emphasized leadership theories in this book. Instead, we organized the book according to a simple common-sense structure that describes current knowledge on <i>what effective leaders really do.</i> Most of the leader behaviors described in the chapters that follow have been extensively researched as part of various theoretical models proposed by leadership scholars. In this book, we have presented what is known about each leader behavior without the baggage of many different theories. Although these leader behaviors may overlap to some degree, they are widely recognized and discussed by managers and leadership experts. This structure is designed to minimize confusion, to facilitate understanding, and to provide students with some psychological closure on each leader behavior. </p> <p><b>AUDIENCE</b></p> <p> This book is intended for use in any college course that focuses on effective leadership. Examples of these courses include Leadership and Motivation, Leadership in Society, Nursing Leadership, Not-for-Profit Leadership, Leadership in Law Enforcement, or Leadership in Education. The book is also appropriate for a first course in leadership training in business, public, educational, health care, or other organizations. </p> <p><b>STRUCTURE AND FEATURES</b></p> <p> Part I of the book includes three chapters that introduce the concept of leadership and the approach of the book, and describe and evaluate several currently popular theories of leadership. Part II is composed of ten central chapters that focus on five core leadership behavior patterns that have been studied extensively in different organizational contexts. Two chapters each are devoted to leaders' supportiveness, directiveness, participation, reward and punishment, and charismatic behaviors. These core chapters emphasize <i>what effective leaders do</i> by describing in detail each of the core leader behaviors. These chapters also emphasize <i>how they do it</i> by identifying leader traits, skills, and sources of power associated with each behavior as well as examples of effective and ineffective leaders carrying out the behaviors. The core chapters also describe <i>when leaders use each behavior</i> by identifying situational factors that tell effective leaders when a specific core behavior will be most effective. Part III presents three chapters addressing less-researched leader behavior patterns that will be increasingly important in the new millennium and a concluding chapter that describes popular leadership styles that are combinations of the specific leader behaviors described earlier. </p> <p> This book also emphasizes the effects of the increasing number of jobs performed by highly educated and professionally oriented employees who use computer technology and/or teams to perform job activities. These individuals and teams are often able to assume more responsibility with less active direction and control by their formal leaders. These emerging workforce and job structure characteristics do not eliminate the need for leadership, but they help organizations economize by reducing the number of middle managers and allowing workers and work groups more freedom to manage their own daily activities. </p> <p> Examples are provided in each chapter that highlight current and historical leaders who exhibit the leadership behaviors and styles discussed (see the Leadership in Action box on Pat Carrigan, page 4-4). Self-assessment exercises also help the reader understand and apply concepts described in the text (see example on Effective Listening page 4-8). Exercises and short cases are also included to allow students to further understand and apply chapter material (see examples on pages 11-31 entitled Choosing an Appropriate Leadership Style and page 11-37 entitled Move the Supervisors). Numerous illustrations and figures also summarize text material and provide advice on how to apply the material to real leadership situations (see examples on pages 13-26 and 13-27 for charismatic leadership). </p> <p><b>INSTRUCTOR'S MATERIAL</b></p> <ul> <li>Instructor's Manual/Test Item File<br> The Instructor's Manual features Learning Objectives, Lecture Outlines, Answers to Review and Case Questions, and Suggested Activities for each chapter in the text. Included with the Instructor's Manual is a Test Item File offering a variety of True/False, Multiple/Choice, and Essay questions that facilitate different classroom needs.</li> <li>PowerPoint Electronic Transparencies<br> A comprehensive package of text outlines and figures corresponding to the text, the PowerPoint transparencies are designed to aid the educator and supplement in-class lectures.</li> </ul> <p><b>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</b></p> <p> During the ten years it took to complete this book, numerous individuals provided valuable assistance by conducting library research, editing, and discussing with us many of the issues we wrote about. Jim Weber, Jennifer Villa, Jim Paul, Michael Clugston, and Lori Paris all provided capable and generous support to our efforts. The College of Business and New Mexico State University provided the library facilities and the environment that allowed us to persist on the project. Our long-time friend and colleague, Peter Dorfman, asked many thought-provoking questions about our project and participated with us on various research projects that produced findings reported in the book. Our families put up with our long hours of work over the years with words of encouragement and they never wavered in their confidence that we would complete the project. The many reviewers who read and commented on earlier versions of the manuscript provided the essential feedback we needed to keep the book relevant to students of leadership as well as true to the leadership literature. </p></p><h2>Heirloom Country Gardens: Timeless Treasures for Today&#39;s Gardeners (Rodale Organic Gardening Book)</h2><p>Presents a guide to growing heirloom plants, and introduces a wide range of regional styles, flowers, herbs, vegetables, and fruits, along with advice on how to plant and cultivate them.</p><p>Love history as much as you love plants? Interested in resurrecting some nearly forgotten and delicious garden vegetables? <i>Heirloom Country Gardens</i> offers a wealth of suggestions in a lovely format that mixes gorgeous photos with fascinating text. Author Sarah Wolfgang Heffner begins with an introduction to many types of regionally preferred layouts--traditional Amish, New England, Southern, Victorian, and Southwest Mission are but a few. Whether you're interested in reinventing your entire garden in a particular style or simply incorporating a few elements, you'll find the detailed descriptions and bulleted lists to be helpful companions.<p> The alphabetical listing of vegetables, flowers, herbs, and fruits includes both general notes and specific types of special heirloom plants. Purple carrots? White cucumbers? Each category offers at least four choices--some, like the Moons and Stars melon, are famous in the move to restore older breeds. Plant history is included in this section--did you know it was once believed that basil could actually turn into a scorpion, if two leaves were left under a rock? Flowers are given the same loving attention, while fruits are treated a bit differently. </p><p> As local conditions can vary so drastically for optimal fruit growing, Heffner urges you to get recommendations from local nurseries, while including interesting historical facts and a few general suggestions. Organic methods of disease and pests control are emphasized, and the instructions for training plants and retaining seeds excel in their completeness and simplicity. <i>--Jill Lightner</i></p>Sarah Wolfgang Heffner was the orchard manager for the Rodale Institute Orchard Project for 10 years. She lives and gardens on a historic farm in Berks County, PA.</p><h2>The Divine Comedy (Wordsworth Classics of World Literature)</h2><p>Dante Alighieri (1265-1321) is one of the most important and innovative figures of the European Middle Ages. Writing his Comedy (the epithet Divine was added by later admirers) in exile from his native Florence, he aimed to address a world gone astray both morally and politically. At the same time, he sought to push back the restrictive rules which traditionally governed writing in the Italian vernacular, to produce a radically new and all-encompassing work. The Comedy tells of the journey of a character who is at one and the same time both Dante himself and Everyman through the three realms of the Christian afterlife: Hell, Purgatory and Heaven. He presents a vision of the afterlife which is strikingly original in its conception, with a complex architecture and a coherent structure. On this journey Dante&#39;s protagonist - and his reader - meet characters who are variously noble, grotesque, beguiling, fearful, ridiculous, admirable, horrific and tender, and through them he is shown the consequences of sin, repentance and virtue, as he learns to avoid Hell and, through cleansing in Purgatory, to taste the joys of Heaven.</p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.The &#34;Inferno,&#34; the &#34;Purgatorio,&#34; and the &#34;Paradiso,&#34; comprise The Divine Comedy. Led by the souls of Virgil and his love Beatrice, Dante crosses the gulfs of Hell, climbs the mountain of Purgatory and arrives through the spheres of Heaven in the presence of God. Replete with symbolism and allusions based on Dante&#39;s fluency with philosophy, astronomy, natural science, politics and history, it is also widely recognized as one of the most influential works in the Western canon.</p><h2>Taber&#39;s Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary (Non-thumb-indexed Version) (Taber&#39;s Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary (Non-Indexed Version))</h2><p><p><strong>Taber&#x2019;s 22 brings meanings to life! </strong></p><br><p>In hand, online, or on your mobile device&#x2014;anywhere and everywhere,<br>Taber&#x2019;s 22 is the all-in-one, go-to source in the classroom, clinical,<br>and beyond. </p><br><p>Under the editorial direction of Donald Venes, MD, MSJ, a team of<br>expert consulting editors and consultants, representing nearly every<br>health care profession, ensures that the content reflects the most<br>current healthcare information. </p><br><p>A wealth of resources puts the language of nursing, medicine and the healthcare professions at your fingertips...</p><br><ul><br> <li><strong>FREE,</strong> <strong>1-year subscription</strong> to <strong>Taber&#x2019;s Online</strong>, powered by Unbound Medicine, and now with annual updates&#x2014;puts all of the knowledge of Taber&#x2019;s at your fingertips.</li><br> <li><strong>FREE, Taber&#x2019;s Flash, </strong>a flash card app&#x2014;simplifies studying.</li><br> <li><strong>Web, mobile,</strong> and <strong>print platforms</strong>&#x2014;ensure access in any setting.</li><br> <li><strong>Crossword puzzles, flashcards, and listen-and-learn activities</strong>&#x2014;meet the needs of visual, kinesthetic, and auditory learners.</li><br> <li><strong>Over 30,000 audio pronunciations</strong>&#x2014;build speaking confidence.</li><br></ul></p><p></p><h2>The Pants Project</h2><p><p><em>Okay, here goes.

Illustrated notes throughout the text explain the historical background of the story.</p><p>Grade 6-9. These visually appealing abridgments of classic titles make fairly difficult and complex novels accessible to a junior high audience.

Beginning with table-of-contents pages that feature portraits of the casts of characters, the books then devote a few pages to setting the place and mood of the tales. Two-page spreads of text and drawings are framed by related facts and illustrated with details from paintings, photographs, and even movie stills, all of which provide fascinating geographical, historical, and archaeological tidbits.

With new cover treatment for mass market paperback.<br> A new installment in the award-winning Vorkosigan science fiction adventure series.<br><br>Captain Ivan Vorpatril sometimes thinks that if not for his family, he might have no troubles at all. But he has the dubious fortune of the hyperactive Miles Vorkosigan as a cousin, which has too often led to his getting dragged into one of Miles&#x2019; schemes, with risk to life and limb&#x2014;and military career&#x2014;that Ivan doesn&#x2019;t consider entirely fair. Much practice has made Ivan more adept at fending off his mother&#x2019;s less-than-subtle reminders that he should be getting married and continuing the Vorpatril lineage.<br><br>Fortunately, his current duty is on the planet Komarr as staff officer to Admiral Desplains, far from both his cousin and his mother back on their homeworld of Barrayar.

That Byerly is characteristically vague about the nature of the danger, not to mention the lady&#x2019;s name, should have been Ivan&#x2019;s first clue, but Ivan is no more able to turn aside from aiding a damsel in distress than he could resist trying to rescue a kitten from a tree.<br><br>It is but a short step down the road of good intentions to the tangle of Ivan&#x2019;s life, in trouble with the Komarran authorities, with his superiors, and with the lethal figures hunting the mysterious but lovely Tej and her exotic blue companion Rish&#x2014;a tangle to test the lengths to which Ivan will go as an inspired protector.<br><br>But though his predicament is complicated, at least Ivan doesn&#x2019;t have to worry about hassle from family.

For years fans have clamored for Ivan Vorpatril&#x2019;s story, and at last Bujold delivers something that will both thrill the devoted audience and entrance new readers. For many years, Ivan has been perfectly content to live a quiet bachelor life and serve as a staff officer to a Barrayaran admiral. With no desire for the imperial throne or the types of death-defying adventures that his cousin Miles so adores, Ivan has become a master at avoiding political intrigue and entangling alliances. Asked to look after a young woman during a brief trip to Komarr, Ivan is happy to oblige. But when his attempt to ask the woman out ends up with her handmaiden knocking him out and tying him to a chair, Ivan realizes that something very bad is going on. It quickly becomes clear that the only way Ivan can save himself and his charge is to marry Tej Arqua and bring her home to Barrayar. Longtime readers will love seeing a new side of Ivan as well as hearing his views on many of the series characters. New readers can enjoy Ivan&#x2019;s story on its own but will miss many of the nuances that add depth and character; best to begin at the beginning. Essential for all SF collections and a must-read for Bujold and Vorkosigan fans. HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY: In the SF world, a new release doesn&#x2019;t get much bigger than this one. The wait is finally over for Bujold&#x2019;s followers. --Jessica Moyer</p><h2>The Great Philosophers: An Introduction to Western Philosophy</h2><p>Western philosophy remains one of the greatest glories of world civilization, yet surprisingly few people have any real knowledge of it. Based on fifteen dialogues between Bryan Magee and some of today's internationally-known scholars and philosophers, <em>The Great Philosophers</em> presents an accessible, intellectually stimulating history of philosophy from Plato to the present day.<br> Beginning with the death of Socrates in 399 B.C. and the subsequent writings of Plato--the first Western philosopher whose works have survived--they carry the story through the work of Aristotle and the medieval philosophers; the writings of Descartes and other seventeenth-century philosophers including Spinoza, Leibniz, and Locke; the work of Berkeley and the eighteenth-century thinkers, Hume and Kant; the theories of the nineteenth-century encompassed in the writings of Hegel, Marx, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche; to the twentieth-century ideas included in the works of Husserl, Heidegger and the modern existentialists, Frege, Russell, Wittgenstein, and the American pragmatists. The contributors include such influential figures as Martha Nussbaum, Bernard Williams, Anthony Quinton, Michael Ayers, Geoffrey Warnock, Peter Singer, Hubert Dreyfus, Sidney Morgenbesser, and John Searle, all who offer lively and clear discussions of difficult philosophical concepts. <em>The Great Philosophers</em> provides an absorbing introduction to the concepts of Western philosophy and to its greatest thinkers.</p><p><br><em>About the Author</em>:<br> <strong>Bryan Magee</strong> is a writer, critic, and broadcaster whose books include <em>Men of Ideas</em> and <em>Modern British Philosophy</em>.<br>Magee has taught philosophy at Oxford, and in each of these volumes he attempts to make philosophy understandable to the lay reader. The DK book devotes just a few pages to each of the major thinkers and is lavishly illustrated. It would be suitable for high school, college, and public libraries. Great Philosophers is a series of conversations with important contemporary philosophers about the major historical figures, originally produced for the BBC. Confessions is an autobiographical excursion through Western philosophy. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Psychology and Life (Mypsychlab)</h2><p><p> <b> <i> <b>Bringing Psychological Research to Life</b> </i> </b> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <i>Psychology and Life, 20th </i>edition provides the perfect balance of science and accessibility so that students can understand research and its application to daily life.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Richarg Gerrig combines classic and cutting-edge research studies with an engaging and student friendly writing style.&nbsp;When paired with&nbsp;the new Pearson Experiments Tool and MyPsychLab, this new edition truly brings psychological research to life.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <b>A better teaching and learning experience</b> </p> <p>This program will provide a better teaching and learning experience - for you and your students.

The evolution of various genres, instrumentation, minstrelsy, dance, religious aspects, recording companies, and musical theater are all dealt with meticulously. A chronology of important events at the beginning of each chapter and extensive bibliographies and discographies help greatly in navigating the massive amount of material.

By 1965, he was representing Mark di Suvero, was the first to show Andy Warhol&#x2019;s pop art, and pioneered the practice of &#x201c;off-site&#x201d; exhibitions and introduced the new genre of installation art. As a dealer, he helped discover and champion many of the innovative successors to the abstract expressionists, including Claes Oldenburg, James Rosenquist, Donald Judd, Dan Flavin, Walter De Maria, and many others. </p><p>The founder and director of the fabled Green Gallery on Fifty-Seventh Street, Bellamy thrived on the energy of the sixties. With the covert support of America&#x2019;s first celebrity art collectors, Robert and Ethel Scull, Bellamy gained his footing just as pop art, minimalism, and conceptual art were taking hold and the art world was becoming a playground for millionaires. Yet as an eccentric impresario dogged by alcohol and uninterested in profits or posterity, Bellamy rarely did more than show the work he loved. As fellow dealers such as Leo Castelli and Sidney Janis capitalized on the stars he helped find, Bellamy slowly slid into obscurity, becoming the quiet man in oversize glasses in the corner of the room, a knowing and mischievous smile on his face.</p><p>Born to an American father and a Chinese mother in a Cincinnati suburb, Bellamy moved to New York in his twenties and made a life for himself between the Beat orbits of Provincetown and white-glove events like the Guggenheim&#x2019;s opening gala. No matter the scene, he was always considered &#x201c;one of us,&#x201d; partying with Norman Mailer, befriending Diane Arbus and Yoko Ono, and hosting or performing in historic Happenings. From his early days at the Hansa Gallery to his time at the Green to his later life as a private dealer, Bellamy had his finger on the pulse of the culture. </p><p>Based on decades of research and on hundreds of interviews with Bellamy&#x2019;s artists, friends, colleagues, and lovers, Judith E. Stein&#x2019;s <i>Eye of the Sixties</i> rescues the legacy of the elusive art dealer and tells the story of a counterculture that became the mainstream. A tale of money, taste, loyalty, and luck, Richard Bellamy&#x2019;s life is a remarkable window into the art of the twentieth century and the making of a generation&#x2019;s aesthetic.</p><p>--</p><p>"Bellamy had an understanding of art and a very fine sense of discovery. There was nobody like him, I think. I certainly consider myself his pupil." --Leo Castelli</p></p><p><b>Judith E.

Stein perfectly captures the circus that was the art world of the sixties, in which Richard Bellamy was an inadvertent but essential ringmaster. He was a poet dreamer, an iconoclastic hipster who was as short on business acumen as he was long on vision. Unburdened by art history, his legendary galleries were arenas of possibility; in silence, with intuition and innocence of eye, his guileless ability to identify authentic artists&#x2015;from Di Suvero to Oldenburg and from Rosenquist to Judd&#x2015;was uncanny, matched only by the strategies of the great Leo Castelli.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;Adam D.

The artists he showed at his transformative Green Gallery define the canonical American art movements of the sixties. In Judith E. Stein&#x2019;s meticulously researched and magnetically animated biography, we see this formative moment in American art through Bellamy&#x2019;s eyes.

He is a distinguished soldier and she is beautiful and intelligent. However, what lies beneath the surface of their marriage is far more sinister and their influence leads John into a tragic drama that threatens to destroy everything he cares about.<br><br>Ford Madox Ford wrote <i>The Good Soldier</i>, the book on which his reputation most surely rests, in deliberate emulation of the nineteenth-century French novels he so admired. In this way he was able to explore the theme of sexual betrayal and its poisonous after-effects with a psychological intimacy as yet unknown in the English novel.</p><p>(Book Jacket Status: Not Jacketed)</p></p><p>First published in 1915, Ford Madox Ford's <i>The Good Soldier</i> begins, famously and ominously, "This is the saddest story I have ever heard." The book then proceeds to confute this pronouncement at every turn, exposing a world less sad than pathetic, and more shot through with hypocrisy and deceit than its incredulous narrator, John Dowell, cares to imagine. Somewhat forgotten as a classic, <i>The Good Soldier</i> has been called everything from the consummate novelist's novel to one of the greatest English works of the century. And although its narrative hook--the philandering of an otherwise noble man--no longer shocks, its unerring cadences and doleful inevitabilities proclaim an enduring appeal.<p> Ford's novel revolves around two couples: Edward Ashburnham--the title's soldier--and his capable if off-putting wife, Leonora; and long-transplanted Americans John and Florence Dowell. The foursome's ostensible amiability, on display as they pass parts of a dozen pre-World War I summers together in Germany, conceals the fissures in each marriage. John is miserably mismatched with the garrulous, cuckolding Florence; and Edward, dashing and sentimental, can't refrain from falling in love with women whose charms exceed Leonora's. Predictably, Edward and Florence conduct their affair, an indiscretion only John seems not to notice. After the deaths of the two lovers, and after Leonora explains much of the truth to John, he recounts the events of their four lives with an extended inflection of outrage. From his retrospective perch, his recollections simmer with a bitter skepticism even as he expresses amazement at how much he overlooked.</p><p> Dowell's resigned narration is flawlessly conversational--haphazard, sprawling, lusting for sympathy. He exudes self-preservation even as he alternately condemns and lionizes Edward: "If I had had the courage and the virility and possibly also the physique of Edward Ashburnham I should, I fancy, have done much what he did." Stunningly, Edward's adultery comes to seem not merely excusable, but almost sublime. "Perhaps he could not bear to see a woman and not give her the comfort of his physical attractions," John surmises. Ford's novel deserves its reputation if for no other reason than the elegance with which it divulges hidden lives. <i>--Ben Guterson</i></p>Ford Madox Ford wrote The Good Soldier, the book on which his reputation most surely rests, in deliberate emulation of the nineteenth-century French novels he so admired.

Invented to frighten evil spirits rather than fuel guns or bombs-neither of which had been thought of yet-their simple mixture of saltpeter, sulfur, and charcoal went on to make the modern world possible. As word of its explosive properties spread from Asia to Europe, from pyrotechnics to battleships, it paved the way for Western exploration, hastened the end of feudalism and the rise of the nation state, and greased the wheels of the Industrial Revolution.With dramatic immediacy, novelist and journalist Jack Kelly conveys both the distant time in which the &#34;devil&#39;s distillate&#34; rose to conquer the world, and brings to rousing life the eclectic cast of characters who played a role in its epic story, including Michelangelo, Edward III, Vasco da Gama, Cortez, Guy Fawkes, Alfred Nobel, and E.I. DuPont. A must-read for history fans and military buffs alike, Gunpowder brings together a rich terrain of cultures and technological innovations with authoritative research and swashbuckling style.</p><p><b>Jack Kelly</b> is both an accomplished novelist and an experienced author of popular history. He writes regularly for American Heritage, and has also written features about the DuPont family's involvement in the gunpowder industry and the history of fireworks in America. He lives in Milan, New York.A novelist and popular history writer, Kelly traces the history of gunpowder from 10th-century China to the late 19th century, when it was supplanted by Alfred Nobel&#x2019;s nitroglycerin. Kelly takes advantage of gunpowder&#x2019;s role in the histories of armaments and war to titillate with gruesome but fascinating accounts of the atrocities the destructive power of gunpowder visited on Europe: in the 30 Years War, the German states lost an estimated eight million people&#x2014;one-third of their population. As opposed to the shocking immediacy with which the atomic bomb entered collective consciousness, gunpowder and its accompanying technology developed as effective instruments of war over hundreds of years. But of the two, Kelly says, gunpowder has had a greater impact on the course of civilization. For example, he argues plausibly that, by the 16th century, the cost of gunpowder needed by an effective fighting force "favored strong centralized states" with the authority and ability to tax and in turn created "the foundations of modern nations." This miscellany jumps between the technical developments that continually improved gunpowder (readers will know more than they ever felt necessary about the creation of saltpeter), and gunpowder&#x2019;s cultural impact. Kelly&#x2019;s erudition ranges from the development of the science of ballistics to the infamous 1605 Guy Fawkes gunpowder plot to blow up the English parliament. Kelly (Line of Sight, etc.) writes well and has a terrific eye for the instructive detail or odd historical fact that brings the narrative to life. It is an entertaining and readable effort. 36 b&amp;w illus.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

When standing before an ancient tablet in a museum or visiting an Egyptian monument, we marvel at this unique writing and puzzle over its meaning. Now, with the help of Egyptologists Mark Collier and Bill Manley, museum-goers, tourists, and armchair travelers alike can gain a basic knowledge of the language and culture of ancient Egypt.<br><br>Collier and Manley's novel approach is informed by years of experience teaching Egyptian hieroglyphs to non-specialists. Using attractive drawings of actual inscriptions displayed in the British Museum, they concentrate on the kind of hieroglyphs readers might encounter in other collections, especially funerary writings and tomb scenes. Each chapter introduces a new aspect of hieroglyphic script or Middle Egyptian grammar and encourages acquisition of reading skills with practical exercises.<br><br>The texts offer insights into the daily experiences of their ancient authors and touch on topics ranging from pharaonic administration to family life to the Egyptian way of death. With this book as a guide, one can enjoy a whole new experience in understanding Egyptian art and artifacts around the world.</p><p>You need no previous experience reading hieroglyphs to benefit from this book. This is a hieroglyphs guide for the layperson, tourist, or museum enthusiast who'd like to have more of a clue when it comes to understanding Egyptian hieroglyphs. Focusing on the funerary symbols one would be likely to see in Egypt or at a museum, and illustrated with hieroglyphs that are on display in the British Museum (drawn by Richard Parkinson, curator in the Department of Egyptian Antiquities at the British Museum), <i>How to Read Egyptian Hieroglyphs</i> makes possible a deeper appreciation not just of museum displays but of the Egyptian culture that used this writing system.<p> Both experts in Egyptology (Collier teaches Egyptology at the University of Liverpool, and Manley teaches the subject at the University of Glasgow), they explain how most hieroglyphs are used to convey the <i>sound</i> of the ancient Egyptian language, then go on to teach, in easily digestible segments, the basic phonograms (sound-signs) used in inscriptions a traveler or museum-goer would be most likely to encounter. Each chapter teaches a new portion of hieroglyphic script and a new aspect of the Middle Egyptian grammar, with a section to practice the new reading skills and exercises to solidify the lessons taught. It provides a wonderful opportunity to sit at home and learn about the pharaonic administration, ancient Egyptian family life, and the Egyptian way of death, while building a firm understanding of the most common features of hieroglyphs. <i>--Stephanie Gold</i></p><b>Mark Collier</b> is a lecturer in Egyptology at the University of Liverpool. <b>Bill Manley</b> teaches Egyptology at the University of Glasgow. <b>Richard Parkinson</b> is a curator in the Department of Egyptian Antiquities at the British Museum.</p><h2>How to Build a Habitable Planet: The Story of Earth from the Big Bang to Humankind - Revised and Expanded Edition</h2><p><p><b>A classic introduction to the story of Earth's origin and evolution&#x2015;revised and expanded for the twenty-first century</b></p><p>Since its first publication more than twenty-five years ago, <i>How to Build a Habitable Planet</i> has established a legendary reputation as an accessible yet scientifically impeccable introduction to the origin and evolution of Earth, from the Big Bang through the rise of human civilization.

A master of magic and a superb story-teller, Tuhami lives in a dank, windowless hovel near the kiln where he works. Nightly he suffers visitations from the demons and saints who haunt his life, and he seeks, with crippling ambivalence, liberation from 'A'isha Qandisha, the she-demon.<br> <br> In a sensitive and bold experiment in interpretive ethnography, Crapanzano presents Tuhami's bizarre account of himself and his world. In so doing, Crapanzano draws on phenomenology, psychoanalysis, and symbolism to reflect upon the nature of reality and truth and to probe the limits of anthropology itself. <i>Tuhami</i> has become one of the most important and widely cited representatives of a new understanding of the whole discipline of anthropology.<br></p></p><p>"A powerful case for the place of self-reflexivity in all ethnographic writing. . . . Not the least of the anxieties Crapanzano portrays is tied to the notion of realism, sharply revealed here as a Western convention. The interviews were to have resulted in a biography, or, in social science jargon, a 'life history.' But the effect of the encounter was to undermine the expected meanings of both 'life' and 'history.'"<br> (James Clifford <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)</p><h2>Criminal Procedure: Investigation and Right to Counsel [Connected Casebook] (Aspen Casebook)</h2><p><p>Buy a&nbsp;<strong>new version</strong>&nbsp;of this Connected Casebook and receive&nbsp;<strong>access</strong>&nbsp;to the&nbsp;<strong>online e-book</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>practice questions&nbsp;</strong>from your favorite study aids, and an&nbsp;<strong>outline tool</strong>&nbsp;on CasebookConnect, the all in one learning solution for law school students.

Miller, an Outward Bound instructor and writer, has collected oral histories from various tribes throughout North America. This collection surveys celestial myths relating to creation, coming of age, hunting, and tricksters, and it conveys the values, rituals, and everyday life of Native American culture. A brief introduction to the constellations from the Ancient Greek perspective is included, along with star maps showing major features. North American Native American culture areas are broken down into major tribes, with entries varying in length. The book should complement earlier works on the stars or on North American Indians.

Speaking under the broad theme of human development in the light of Anthroposophy, he analyzes the gulf between contemporary culture and science--which he says are characterized by &#x201c;narrow-mindedness, ignorance and ineptitude&#x201d;--and a scientific approach to the spirit. Steiner is clear about the shortcomings of his followers, mentioning past failures and a continuing tendency toward sectarianism and dogmatic judgments. Steiner also discusses how we experience a state of separation from the world through our physical form, whereas our aura, or soul, spiritual being&#x2015;is already living actively in cosmic surroundings. Consciously crossing of the threshold into the spiritual world is urgent and needed today, although Steiner warns of the dangers inherent in certain Eastern and Western approaches. The tendency of initiates of the East is to abandon the human race, while the American impulse has become too immersed in physical, bodily nature. Moreover, a potential demonic influence works through technology. However, a spiritual-scientific path of knowledge and development can allow us to navigate through these challenges.</p><p><b>Rudolf Steiner</b>&nbsp;(1861&#x2013;1925) was born in the small village of Kraljevec, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Croatia), where he grew up (see right). As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world. He died in Dornach, Switzerland.</p><h2>A Writer&#39;s Reference with Exercises with 2016 MLA Update</h2><p>THIS TITLE HAS BEEN UPDATED TO REFLECT THE 2016 MLA UPDATES!

But there is much, much more in this work. Grice himself has carefully arranged and framed the sequence of essays to emphasize not a certain set of ideas but a habit of mind, a style of philosophizing.</p><p>Grice has, to be sure, provided philosophy with crucial ideas. His account of speaker-meaning is the standard that others use to define their own minor divergences or future elaborations. His discussion of conversational implicatures has given philosophers an important tool for the investigation of all sorts of problems; it has also laid the foundation for a great deal of work by other philosophers and linguists about presupposition. His metaphysical defense of absolute values is starting to be considered the beginning of a new phase in philosophy.

With its focus on the most critical language for communication, its active presentation of vocabulary and grammar, and its inclusion of real-world culture throughout, the program provides a unique framework for the Introductory Spanish course, with two separate but complementary goals in mind: learning to use the language and appreciating the world that it comes from.</p><p> What makes <em>Con�ctate </em>so unique?</p><ul> <li> <strong>A focused approach:</strong> The tailored scope and sequence of <em>Con�ctate</em> allows students to concentrate on what they can reasonably be expected to learn in an introductory course, allowing time for systematic review and recycling. This offers a solution to the Introductory Spanish programs that, in an effort to cover everything, include too much grammar and rush students through the curriculum without spending sufficient time for true learning or mastery. </li> <li> <strong>Active learning:</strong> <em>Con�ctate</em> carefully balances a mix of inductive and explicit vocabulary and grammar presentations, applying the concept of desirable difficulty throughout. This leads students to discover and retain the language, and avoids the common type of presentations that only allow for passive learning. </li> <li> <strong>Integration of culture:</strong> Language is culture and culture is language. This central idea shapes the way culture is treated in <em>Con�ctate</em>: not as something separate from the language acquisition process, but as something that is integral to the process. Students acquire cultural knowledge and understanding in a natural way as they learn how the language is used within the rich and diverse Spanish-speaking world. </li></ul></p><p><p> <strong>Grant Goodall</strong> is Professor of Linguistics and Director of the Language Program at the University of California, San Diego, where he is also affiliated with the Center for Iberian and Latin American Studies.

The blaze at Our Lady of the Angels School shocked the nation. It left many families physically and psychologically scarred for life, destroyed a close-knit working-class neighborhood, and sowed popular suspicion of the church hierarchy and city fathers. No one was ever prosecuted for setting the fire; to this day it remains an officially unsolved mystery. In To Sleep with the Angels, two veteran journalists tell the moving story of the fire and its consequences. David Cowan and John Kuenster have worked for years, talking with hundreds of sources and ferreting our documents to reconstruct a minute-by-minute narrative of the tragedy and the sorrows of its aftermath. It is a story of ordinary people caught up in a mind-numbing disaster. In gripping detail, the authors describe the fear, desperation, and panic that prevailed among children, teachers, firefighters, and parents in and around the stricken school building on that cold Monday afternoon. Beyond the flames, the story of the fire at Our Lady of the Angels became an enigma whose mystery has deepened with time: its cause was never officially explained despite evidence that it had been intentionally set by a troubled student at the school. The authors reveal for the first time this youngster&#39;s &#34;confession&#34; and the decision by a local judge not to pursue the case against him. The Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago also refused to press an investigation, preferring to label the fire a terrible &#34;accident&#34;.David Cowan has been a newspaper reporter in Illinois and is now a fireman and independent journalist who lives in the Chicago area.

But his hot new restaurant, Charcoal Venice, is devoted to the kind of cooking he does at home for his friends and family--backyard cookouts where a pile of coals and seasonal ingredients are all a home cook needs to create an unforgettable meal. In <i>Charcoal</i>, Citrin presents completely fresh ways to cook with fire and charcoal, not only grilling over the coals, but cooking inside them and finding inventive methods for searing and smoking. <br> <br>Whether Citrin's grilling barbecue classics like J1-Marinated Skirt Steak and Salt-Baked Whole Maine Lobster or West Coast-inspired vegetable sides like his signature Cabbage Baked in Embers, charcoal is the dynamic center of this cookbook. Unlike other grilling books, vegetables get equal billing with meat. For Citrin, the color, texture, and flavors of vegetables are endlessly inspiring. With almost 100 recipes for savory main dishes and sides, as well as desserts and even cocktails, <i>Charcoal</i> shows that the satisfaction of smoky flavor and a good char knows no bounds. It is a celebration of the universal human craving to gather together and cook over a live fire.</p><p><b>Josiah Citrin</b> is a respected restaurateur and a fixture of the Los Angeles gourmet dining scene, with more than twenty-five years of experience.

We bury a whole head of plain ol&#x2019; green cabbage and cook it in blistering coals until the outer leaves are caramelized and give way to a soft, steamed interior. Because of its size and density, cabbage lends itself well to the smoldering embers of the fire, where it transforms and emerges juicy, smoky, and meaty. Trust me, even people who think they don&#x2019;t like cabbage&#x2014;they&#x2019;ve only had watery coleslaw or bland cabbage soup&#x2014;go nuts for this addictive starter dish. Served warm, the charred cabbage leaves play off the coolness of the yogurt dipping sauce, which is fragrant with citrusy sumac and lemon. It&#x2019;s simple enough to add another head or two of cabbage for a gathering, and any leftovers you can slice into ribbons to top tacos. Be sure to try the yogurt sauce over any of your favorite grilled vegetables, such as eggplant, or use it as a dressing spooned over fresh tomato salad.</p><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;1 large head green cabbage (about 2 pounds) <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Extra-virgin olive oil <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Fine sea salt <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;1 cup plain whole-milk Greek yogurt <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh chives <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Finely grated zest of 1 lemon <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Juice of � lemon <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;1 teaspoon sumac <br><p>1.Transfer the grill grate from a charcoal grill and build a hot fire with lump charcoal until red-hot. Rub the cabbage lightly with olive oil and season generously with salt, ensuring that all sides are well coated. Put on your fireproof gloves. Make a well in the center of the coals using a rake or shovel, and carefully add the cabbage. Use the rake or shovel to bury the cabbage completely by covering it with the surrounding hot coals. You may grill something on top at the same time if desired. Close the lid to keep the heat in and to prevent the charcoal from burning out too quickly. You want to maintain the temperature at about 400�F by adjusting the vents.</p><p>2.The cabbage should be completely charred and black on all sides and tender in the center in about 1 hour; check by piercing with a cake tester or paring knife. If it&#x2019;s not done, continue roasting in the coals for 5 more minutes. If you are preparing the cabbage ahead, wrap tightly in aluminum foil and keep it warm in a low oven.</p><p>3.In a small mixing bowl, combine the yogurt, chives, lemon zest, lemon juice, and sumac until smooth.</p><p>4.Cut the cabbage through the core into quarters. Cut the core out of each piece. Arrange the cabbage wedges on a serving platter and season lightly with salt. Rip off the cabbage leaves with your fingers and dip into the sauce.</p></p><h2>A Prince of Our Disorder: The Life of T. E. Lawrence</h2><p><p> When this Pulitzer Prize-winning biography first appeared in 1976, it rescued T. E. Lawrence from the mythologizing that had seemed to be his fate. In it, John Mack humanely and objectively explores the relationship between Lawrence's inner life and his historically significant actions. </p><p> Extensive interviews, far-flung correspondence, access to War Office dispatches and unpublished letters provide the basis for Mack's sensitive investigation of the psychiatric dimensions of Lawrence's personality. In addition, Mack examines the pertinent history, politics, and sociology of the time in order to weigh the real forces with which Lawrence contended and which impinged upon him. </p></p><p>John Mack, M.D., was Professor of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, and Founding Director of the Center for Psychology and Social Change, Cambridge, Massachusetts.A hugely admired, and Pulitzer prize-winning, biography which concentrates on the relationship between Lawrence's inner life and the actions and events which grew out of them. It is easy to warm to a biographer who, while drawing on his training as a psychiatrist, is never deceived into thinking that theory can 'explain' his Lawrence. The more Mack discovered about the social contexts of Lawrence's actions and the demands on a public man, the more he understood Lawrence's psychology. The result is a resounding confirmation of this approach to his subject. (Desmond Christy <i>The Guardian</i>)<br><br>We are not likely to get as thorough and judicious a biography of T. E.

Coates, David L. Brunsma, and Abby&nbsp;L. Ferber&nbsp;-- and reflects a very contemporary way of looking at race, minorities, and intergroup relations. Older texts use a "categorical" approach and feature a series of chapters that examine one minority group at a time (African Americans, Latino/a Americans, Asian Americans, Native Americans, etc.). Newer texts designed within the last 5-10 years are more likely to be organized topically, discuss various racial and ethnic minorities within the context of these topics, and use the most current theories and perspectives in this field.<strong><em> The Matrix of Race </em></strong>is built around these core ideas: -Race is a both a social construction and a social institution -Race is intersectional--it is embedded within other statuses (such as gender, social class, sexuality) -Concepts of race change over time and as we move from one physical location to another -We are all active agents in upholding, reproducing, or resisting constructions of race.</p><p><p><strong>Rodney D.

For newcomers and seasoned practitioners alike, they are foundational practices to enter and realize the mind of Buddha. In this sincere and powerful book, Zen teacher Reb Anderson offers teachings and practice stories that elucidate and open up each paramita. Taken together, the six &#x201c;perfections&#x201d; form an integrated and complete path&#x2014;the path of the heroic bodhisattva who vows to practice ceaselessly for the welfare and liberation of all beings.</p><p>Reb Anderson was ordained as a Zen priest at the San Francisco Zen Center by Shunryu Suzuki Roshi in 1970. Since then, Reb has continued to practice at the San Francisco Zen Center, where he served as abbot from 1986 to 1995 and is now a senior dharma teacher. His previous books are <i>Being Upright: Zen Meditation and the Bodhisattva Precepts</i>, <i>Warm Smiles from Cold Mountains: Dharma Talks on Zen Meditation</i>, and <i>The Third Turning of the Wheel: Wisdom of the Samdhinirmocana Sutra</i>.&#x201c;This book offers highly practical and accessible guidance for everyday bodhisattva life dedicated to fostering an awakened, compassionate world. It is also deeply grounded in traditional Buddhist texts and philosophy. Based on his many decades of teaching, Tenshin Anderson Roshi graciously explores the six transcendent bodhisattva practices, sharing illuminating stories both from his residential community and his personal life. Reb reveals Intimacy, with self and others and all beings, as the heart of ultimate awareness. <br><br>These teachings unravel expectations, as when he indicates that true generosity may include welcoming acceptance of our own embarrassing, ungenerous responses. Reb expresses the value of patience amid the processes of frustration and challenge. In truly practicing effort, overwork may reflect laziness. The essence of concentration involves letting go of discursive thinking, not suppression of thoughts. This lively, insightful work elaborates these and many other helpful encouragements to radically realize our own deep selves, and thus to develop our beneficial connection with all beings. Going beyond all these practices, perfect wisdom returns to joyfully renew wholehearted commitment to compassionate engagement. This book will be a valuable resource for both beginning and experienced practitioners or students.&#x201d;&#x2014;Taigen Dan Leighton, author of <i>Faces of Compassion</i> and&nbsp;<i>Just This Is It<br><br></i><br> &#x201c;One can feel Reb Anderson practicing the six perfections in the writing and offering of <i>Entering the Mind of Buddha</i>. Guiding us through these teachings, Reb generously, joyously, patiently interweaves traditional and contemporary Zen stories from a life of teaching and living in community, as well as his personal family life&#x2014;thus clarifying the heroic path of the Bodhisattva and encouraging us to open to the real possibility of walking this path starting now.&#x201d;&#x2014;Linda Ruth Cutts, Senior Dharma Teacher, San Francisco Zen Center<br><br> &#x201c;Inspiring, warm-hearted, and wise, Reb Anderson&#x2019;s book is true to the timeless teachings and true to twenty-first-century life.

Hunter's real-life experiences of surviving cancer. They are straightforward about what life is like after the whirlwind of doctors' visits and radical treatments comes to an end. In the aftermath of this intensely focused period, survivors are often unprepared for their feelings of confusion and disorientation. Questions such as "If I am one of the lucky ones, why am I feeling so blue?" are surprisingly common. As this thoughtful book reveals, for those who survive cancer, life is never the same again.<br> Dancing in Limbo weaves the authors' stories with those of other survivors who tackle the difficult question of what it means to really live. To recreate lives of meaning and purpose, survivors face a myriad of emotional issues. The book shows how survivors deal with loss, fear, anger, hope, and grief. Using personal examples, the authors offer down-to-earth advice on topics including:<br> <ul> <li>Loneliness of survival.<br> </li> <li>How to live with uncertainty without going crazy.<br> </li> <li>Fears of reoccurrence and the wisdom of those worries.<br> </li> <li>The losses that must be grieved in order to move forward.<br> </li> <li>The courage to live with fear and uncertainty without falling into despair.<br> </li> <li>The effect of survivor issues on our most intimate relationships.<br> </li> <li>and much more.</li> </ul> <br> Dancing in Limbo is written for the more than eight million people who have survived cancer, their families, friends, and caregivers.GLENNA HALVORSON-BOYD is a national consultant to health care organizations and has a doctorate in Human Development.

Yet, the metaphor has lodged itself in the contemporary imagination, and new fossil discoveries are often hailed in headlines as revealing the elusive transitional step, the moment when we stopped being &#x201c;animal&#x201d; and started being &#x201c;human.&#x201d; In <i>The Accidental Species</i>, Henry Gee, longtime paleontology editor at <i>Nature</i>, takes aim at this misleading notion, arguing that it reflects a profound misunderstanding of how evolution works and, when applied to the evolution of our own species, supports mistaken ideas about our own place in the universe.&nbsp;Gee presents a robust and stark challenge to our tendency to see ourselves as the acme of creation. Far from being a quirk of religious fundamentalism, human exceptionalism, Gee argues, is an error that also infects scientific thought. Touring the many features of human beings that have recurrently been used to distinguish us from the rest of the animal world, Gee shows that our evolutionary outcome is one possibility among many, one that owes more to chance than to an organized progression to supremacy. He starts with bipedality, which he shows could have arisen entirely by accident, as a by-product of sexual selection, moves on to technology, large brain size, intelligence, language, and, finally, sentience. He reveals each of these attributes to be alive and well throughout the animal world&#x2014;they are not, indeed, unique to our species. <br><br><i>The Accidental Species </i>combines Gee&#x2019;s firsthand experience on the editorial side of many incredible paleontological findings with healthy skepticism and humor to create a book that aims to overturn popular thinking on human evolution&#x2014;the key is not what&#x2019;s missing, but how we&#x2019;re linked.<br></p><p><b>Henry Gee</b> is a senior editor at <i>Nature</i> and the author of such books as <i>Jacob&#x2019;s Ladder</i>, <i>In Search of Deep Time</i>, <i>The Science of Middle-earth</i>, and <i>A Field Guide to Dinosaurs</i>, the last with Luis V. Rey. He lives in Cromer, Norfolk, England, with his family and numerous pets.<br>&#x201c;Henry Gee, paleontology editor at <i>Nature</i>, confronts two commonly held views of evolution and effectively demolishes both, persuasively arguing that evolution doesn&#x2019;t work the way most people believe it does and that the entire concept of &#x2018;human exceptionalism&#x2019; (the idea that humans are fundamentally superior to other animals due to &#x2018;language, technology, or consciousness&#x2019;) is erroneous. . . . He buttresses these points with an impressive and accessible overview of the pattern of human evolution, showing just how little we actually know and arguing that different evolutionary stories could likely fit the extant data.&#x201d;<br> (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;If you only read one book on evolution this year, make it this one. You will be dethroned. But you won&#x2019;t be disappointed.&#x201d; (<i>Geoscientist</i>)<br><br>"<i>The Accidental Species</i> is an excellent guide to our current knowledge of how we got where we are. . . . Highly recommended." (<i>BBC Focus</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Gee sets out vehemently to dispute our common tendency to see ourselves as the pinnacle of creation, the bold, brilliant branch that is the final growth of the evolutionary tree of life. . . . a thought-provoking and challenging book.&#x201d; (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>"With a delightfully irascible sense of humor, Henry Gee reflects on our origin and all the misunderstanding that we impose on it. <i>The Accidental Species</i> is an excellent primer on how&#x2014;and how not&#x2014;to think about human evolution.&#x201d; (Carl Zimmer, author of A Planet of Viruses)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Accidental Species</i> is at once an eminently readable and important book.&nbsp;For almost three decades Henry Gee, senior editor at <i>Nature</i>, has helped bring some of the most important discoveries in paleontology to the scientific community and the public at large. Employing years of experience, sharp wit, and great erudition, Gee reveals how most of our popular conceptions of evolution are wrong. Gee delights in shedding us of our assumptions to reveal how science has the power to inform, enlighten, and ultimately surprise.&#x201d; (Neil Shubin, author of Your Inner Fish)<br><br>&#x201c;Quite simply, the best book ever written about the fossil record and humankind&#x2019;s place in evolution.&#x201d; (John Gribbin, author of Alone in the Universe: Why Our Planet Is Unique)<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;If you only read one book on human evolution, or indeed one book on evolution, make it this one.&#x201d; (Ted Nield, author of Incoming and Supercontinent)<br><br>&#x201c;You may think there was nothing more to say about evolution, but <i>The Accidental Species</i> proves that there is&#x2015;and wonderful stuff it is.&#x201d; (Brian Clegg <i>Popular Science Book Review</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Gee is a paleontologist, an evolutionary biologist and a senior editor at the journal <i>Nature</i>. He is also a blues musician and a major Tolkien fan &#x2015; a set of quirky characteristics that may help explain the combination of science and humor that pervades <i>The Accidental Species</i>. It is Gee&#x2019;s contention that scientists have been completely wrong in seeing humans as the apex of evolution. He denies that we developed big brains, the ability to use tools and all the rest through some kind of progression toward superiority. It was a lot more random, he says: We just kind of turned out this way. He illustrates his premise with detailed analysis and a mocking tone.&#x201d; (<i>Washington Post</i>)</p><h2>Architecture and Disjunction (The MIT Press)</h2><p><p>Avant-garde theorist and architect Bernard Tschumi is equally well known for his writing and his practice. <i>Architecture and Disjunction</i>, which brings together Tschumi's essays from 1975 to 1990, is a lucid and provocative analysis of many of the key issues that have engaged architectural discourse over the past two decades&#x2015;from deconstructive theory to recent concerns with the notions of event and program.

He opposes modernist ideology and postmodern nostalgia since both impose restrictive criteria on what may be deemed "legitimate" cultural conditions. He argues for focusing on our immediate cultural situation, which is distinguished by a new postindustrial "unhomeliness" reflected in the ad hoc erection of buildings with multipurpose programs.

The convenience of a bread machine and food processor is certainly desirable with today&#39;s busy lifestyles, particularly as it also affords the pleasant homey smells of baking bread to permeate the kitchen. However, many also still enjoy the artistry of a hand-shaped loaf, as well as the satisfaction that comes from kneading the dough by hand, the almost miraculous creation of a delicious food product from the mere combination of flour, liquid, and yeast. And even more are those who can truly enjoy both methods, with the machine ready when pressed for time, and a desire for the more traditional method on a lazy afternoon. Whole Grain Breads by Machine or Hand will take all readers, regardless of what equipment they have, step-by-step through everything they will need to know in order to make their own delicious whole grain breads by hand, electric mixer, food processor, or bread machine. The subtleties of each method are explained in every recipe, ensuring perfect results every time. From sourdoughs to coffee breads to your standard sandwich-building fare, here is everything the expert and novice baker needs to enjoy the pleasures of fresh homemade bread. Everyone knows that whole grains make great health sense, and now anyone can use them to create flavors to enjoy again and again.

The CD-ROM has spell-check capability and can be used in conjunction with any Microsoft� Office application to get definitions at the click of a mouse.</p><p>The latest edition of the <i>American Heritage Dictionary</i> is out, and that's hot news--not just for the resolute followers of lexicographical minutiae, but for the general reading and writing public as well. Why? Because the <i>American Heritage</i> is a long-standing favorite family dictionary (never underestimate the value of pictures) and one of the prime dictionary references for magazines, newspapers, and dot.com content providers. For scads of writers and editors across the U.S., it sets the standard on matters of style and lexicographical authority.<p> So this new edition is exciting and noteworthy, but how good is it? In its favor, the fourth edition is as current a dictionary as you can get. It's six years fresher than the 1994 version, with 10,000 words and definitions you won't find in the still venerable but now slightly dated third edition. For example, unlike its predecessor (and also unlike the 1996 <i>Oxford Encyclopedic English Dictionary</i>), this fourth edition covers <i>dot-com</i>, <i>e-commerce</i>, and <i>soccer mom</i>, <i>Ebonics</i>, <i>Viagra</i>, and a <i>surf</i> definition for cruising television channels and the Internet.</p><p> Its panel of special consultants includes authorities on anthropology, architecture, cinema, and law, plus military science, music, religion, and sports, and that is reflected in an impressively comprehensive coverage of the arts, culture, and technology. Sadly, however, there are no medical consultants on the panel, and that loss is felt in some substandard medical definitions. Other flaws: there's a greater than usual tendency to define a word with a form of the same word--for example, <i>fuzzy</i>, whose first two definitions are "1. covered with fuzz." and "2. of or resembling fuzz." And some definitions seem needlessly wordy, such as the entry for <i>furious</i>, which is "full of or characterized by extreme anger; raging." Compare that with the more succinct <i>Oxford Encyclopedic</i> entry: "1. extremely angry. 2. full of fury."</p><p> On the other hand, there are valuable entries throughout the dictionary supplying additional information on synonyms, usage, or word history, and these extras, such as the history of <i>diatribe</i> and the usage notes on <i>discomfit</i>, are interesting. The layout is easy on the eyes, with dark blue/green bold type setting the words apart from their definitions, and 4,000 color photographs, maps, and illustrations that are both useful and delightful. On one page, the margin provides color depictions of Francis Bacon, bacterium, and a Bactrian camel. Theodore Roosevelt and a rooster share another margin, while a third page offers Isak Dinesen, a dingo, and dinoflagellate. It is a fascinating book to peruse, and a compellingly scholarly addition to the <i>American Heritage Dictionary</i> line. <i>--Stephanie Gold</i></p><b>*</b> Over 70,000 entries<br><b>*</b> Thoroughly revised and updated<br><b>*</b> 1,000 new words and meanings<br><b>*</b> Over 400 photographs and illustrations<br><b>*</b> Expert guidance on correct usage<br><br>Based on the bestselling <b>American Heritage</b>� <b>Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition</b><br><br>American Heritage� dictionaries are widely known as the most innovative and informative dictionaries in today's market.

Though a business associate of my father, Mr. Grummage was, like my father, a gentleman. It was he my father delegated to make the final arrangements for my passage to America. He was also to meet me when I came down from school on the coach, then see me safely stowed aboard the ship that my father had previously selected.</p><p>Mr. Grummage was dressed in a black frock coat with a stove pipe hat that added to his considerable height. His somber, sallow face registered no emotion. His eyes might have been those of a dead fish.</p><p>"Miss Doyle?" he said as I stepped from the Liverpool coach.</p><p>"Yes, sit. Are you Mr. Grummage?"</p><p>"I am."</p><p>"Pleased to meet you," I said, dipping a curtsy.</p><p>"Quite," he returned. "Now, Miss Doyle, if you would be so good as to indicate which is your trunk, I have a man here to carry it. Next, please oblige me by following, and everything shall be as it is meant to be."</p><p>"Might I say good-bye to my chaperon?"</p><p>"Is that necessary?"</p><p>"She's been very kind."</p><p>"Make haste then."</p><p>In a flutter of nervousness I identified my trunk, threw my arms about Miss Emerson (my sweet companion for the trip down), and bid her a tearful farewell. Then I rushed after Mr. Grummage, who had already begun to move on. A rough-looking porter, laboring behind, carried my trunk upon his back.</p><p>Our little parade reached dockside in good order. There I became instantly agog at the mass of ships that lay before us, masts and spars thick as the bristles on a brush. Everywhere I looked I saw mountains of rare goods piled high. Bales of silk and tobacco! Chests of tea! A parrot! A monkey! Oh yes, the smell of the sea was intoxicating to one who knew little more than the smell of the trim cut lawns and the fields of the Barrington School. Then too, the surging crowds of workers, sailors, and merchants-all rough-hewn, brawny men--created an exotic late afternoon hubbub. All in all it was a most delicious chaos, which, while mildly menacing, was no less exciting because of that. Indeed, in some vague way I had the feeling that it was all there for me.</p><p>"Mr. Grummage, sit," I called over the din. "What is the name of the ship I'm to sail on?"</p><p>Mr. Grummage paused briefly to look at me as though surprised I was there, to say nothing of asking a question. Then from one of his pockets he drew a screw of paper. Squinting at it he pronounced, "The Seahawk."</p><p>"Is she British or American?"</p><p>"American."</p><p>"A merchant ship?"</p><p>"To be sure."</p><p>"How many masts?"</p><p>"I don't know."</p><p>"Will the other families already be on board?"</p><p>"I should think so," he answered, exasperation in his voice. "For your information, Miss Doyle, I received word that departure was being put off, but when I checked with the captain directly he informed me that there must have been some misunderstanding. The ship is scheduled to leave with the first tide tomorrow morning. So there can be no delay."</p><p>To prove the point he turned to move again. 1, however, unable to quell my excited curiosity, managed to slip in one more question.</p><p>"Mr, Grummage, sir, what is the captain's name?"</p><p>Mr. Grummage stopped again, frowning in an irritated fashion, but all the same consulted his paper. "Captain Jaggery," he announced and once more turned to go.</p><p>"Here!" the porter exclaimed suddenly. He had come up close and overheard our talk. Both Mr. Grummage and I looked about.</p><p>"Did you say Captain Jaggery?" the porter demanded.</p><p>"Are you addressing me?" Mr. Grummage inquired, making it perfectly clear that if so, the porter had committed a serious breach of decorum.</p><p>"I was," the man said, talking over my head. "And I'm asking if I heard right when you said we was going to a ship mastered by a certain Captain Jaggery." He spoke the name Jaggery as if it were something positively loathsome.</p><p>"I was not addressing you," Mr. Grummage informed the man.</p><p>"But I hears you all the same," the porter went on, and so saying, he swung my trunk down upon the dock with such a ferocious crack that I feared it would snap in two. "I don't intend to take one more step toward anything to do with a Mr. Jaggery. Not for double gold. Not one more step."</p><p>"See here," Mr. Grummage cried with indignation. "You undertook..."</p><p>"Never mind what I undertook," the man retorted. "It's worth more to me to avoid that man than to close with your coin." And without other word he marched off.</p><p>"Stop! I say, stop!" Mr. Grummage called. It was in vain. The porter had gone, and quickly at that.</p><p>Mr. Grummage and I looked at each other. I hardly knew what to make of it. Nor, clearly, did he. Yet he did what he had to do: he surveyed the area in search of a replacement.</p><p>"There! You man!" he cried to the first who passed by, a huge laboring fellow in a smock. "Here's a shilling if you can carry this young lady's trunk!"</p><p>The man paused, looked at Mr. Grummage, at me, at the trunk. "That?" he asked disdainfully.</p><p>"I'll be happy to add a second shilling," I volunteered, thinking that a low offer was the problem.</p><p>"Miss Doyle," Mr. Grummage snapped. "Let me handle this."</p><p>"Two shillings," the workman said quickly.</p><p>"One," Mr. Grummage countered.</p><p>"Two," the workman repeated and held his hand out to Mr. Grummage, who gave him but one coin. Then the man turned and extended his hand to me.</p><p>Hastily I began to extract a coin from my reticule.</p><p>"Miss Doyle!" Mr. Grummage objected.</p></p><h2>Livy: Book I (Latin Texts)</h2><p><p>Livy's first book covers the 'mythical' period of Rome, from the arrival of Aeneas in Italy, including the founding of Alba Longa and Rome, the lives of Romulus and Remus, and the period of Kingship up to the banishment of the last of the seven kings, Tarquinus Superbus and the election of the first consuls.

It&#39;s a substantial and much needed treatment which broadens the scope of the Enneagram work considerably. Along the way, the author unpacks the &#34;freightload of distractions, accumulated meanings, and cumbersome speculations&#34; that have clogged the clarity of the nine-point diagram.

Years of painstaking research and analysis of previously untapped Japanese-language resources have produced this remarkable study of the navy&#39;s dizzying development, tactical triumphs, and humiliating defeat. Unrivaled in its breadth of coverage and attention to detail, this important new history explores the foreign and indigenous influences on the navy&#39;s thinking about naval warfare and how to plan for it. Focusing primarily on the much-neglected period between the world wars, two widely esteemed historians persuasively explain how the Japanese failed to prepare properly for the war in the Pacific despite an arguable advantage in capability. Maintaining the highest literary standards and supplemented by a dazzling array of charts, diagrams, drawings, and photographs, this landmark work provides much important information not available in any other English-language source. Consciously avoiding the Eurocentric bias of conventional military scholarship, David Evans and Mark Peattie make a unique contribution to naval historiography that will be prized by serious historians and casual readers alike and that promises to spark debate within the academic community.</p><p>Now in paperback for the first time, this classic history of WWII was a recipient of the Society for Military History&#39;s 1999 Distinguished Book Award. It documents the Imperial Japanese Navy&#39;s instrumental role in Japan&#39;s rise from an isolationist feudal kingdom to a potent military empire. Unrivaled in its breadth and attention to detail, this important history explores the foreign and indigenous influences on the Japanese navy&#39;s thinking about naval warfare.David C.

Flicking through the pages of popular photography magazines you might get the impression that there&#x2019;s only one rule of importance&#x2014;the rule of thirds. Indeed it appears that some will judge the merit of a photograph based almost solely on this. Rarely do you hear discussion about visual weight, balance, negative space, depth, and so on. Author and professional photographer Richard Garvey-Williams argues that success lies in a combination of four elements: an impactful subject; dynamic composition; effective use of lighting; and, perhaps the most crucial, ability to invoke an emotional response in the viewer. Citing examples gleaned from a study of history&#x2014;the Ancient Greeks' Golden Rule; Fibonacci's mathematical ratio; and the principles known as the Gestalt theory&#x2014;the author analyzes the concepts, rules, and guidelines that define successful composition in photography and offers practical guidance to achieving great results. In clear, concise, and jargon-free text he also considers the role of tone and color in good composition, and offers invaluable tips and the tools to help the photographer take control of the creative process. The book is illustrated with examples of the author's own beautiful nature photography, along with diagrams and notation to explain techniques most clearly. A final chapter in this definitive guide for all serious photographers discusses photography and its relationship to art before offering a considered conclusion to the exploration of this fascinating topic.</p></p><p><b>Richard Garvey-Williams</b>&nbsp;is a photographer.

This book, the only one on Amelia Earhart endorsed by top aviation authorities, explores the woman, the technology, the circumstances, and the intrigue. Jam-packed with facts that will inform and inspire you, you&#39;ll feel the authors&#39; enthusiasm and love for aviation, and appreciate their attention to detail. So get into your favorite easy chair and fasten your seatbelt. You&#39;re in for an incredible journey. Discover the Answers to These Gripping Questions: Why did she disappear? Was she on a secret spy mission? Was she captured by the Japanese? Has a piece of her airplane or a shoe been found? How accurate was her navigation? Was the flight sabatoged? Was she proficient with her radios? Was she a skiiled-enough pilot? What really happened? The authors---both pilots, mechanics, and aviation experts in their own right---present the true and most accurate story. Breaking new factual and logical ground, a fascinating portrait of Amelia emerges, stripped of media hype, providing a reality known by few. A work of extensive, well documented research, superlative synthesis, and inescapable conclusion, Amelia Earhart--Case Closed? reveals the truth about this courgeous woman and her attempt to circle the globe. You&#39;ll gain a deeper understanding of and appreciation for who this corageous woman was and what she did. You&#39;ll learn the truth about what happened to her and be inspired by her determination... Patty Wagstaff, National Aerobatic Champion, says this in her Foreword: Amelia Earhart was American as apple pie. She&#39;s one of our most beloved heroines, who fascinated the word with her special charm and vision. Decades after her disappearance, we are still intriqued with her exploits, accomplishments, and life. Known to many as AE, she was on a mission, as are all great adventurers and goal achievers. Her mission was our mission and is an integral part of our culture. Amelia combined forward thinking with daring and strove for accomplishment with bravery, and that is her legacy. During the 50s and 60s when I grew up, role models weren&#39;t so designated, however, Amelia was a role model for me. People loved calling her the female Lindbergh, perhaps to explian or justify how a woman could be so capable, confident, and motivated. It was often said that she was ahead of her time, but I believe she was in tune with it. She sensed the opportunities before her and took advantage of them. The reason Amelia is still considered so great is that she forged ahead with her goals. She went up against the odds facing her as a woman, particularly in aviation. She was able to look an interviewer or camera in the eye and talk about her journey and her mission, without apologies or excuses. She never sacrificed her personality or lost her identity. She always maintained her womanhood and a certain sweetness, while participating in what was considered a man&#39;s field. She and many others knew she was a pilot, not just a woman pilot. She was able to transcend preconceived ideas about women in aviation, and advocated women doing other things only men had done. This was her gift to me as a woman, and indeed to all of us. There has never been a shortage of theories about Amelia&#39;s fate. With impeccable qualificaitons as airframe and powerplanet mechanics, pilots, and aviation experts, the authors took on a real challenge with this book.The result is a reader-friendly, provocative book that I couldn&#39;t put down. I felt like I was in the cockpit with Amelia! They present the facts, sharing the results of their well-documented research. As Amelia&#39;s life continues to inspire us, we are fortunate to have this book that reveals the truth about her life and journey.</p><p>LEO GOMEZ was born in Miami, Florida and mile from the Pan American seaplane base, heqadquarters for the flying boats to the Caribbean and South America. He attended school with children of Pan American pilots. Inside the school lobby were busts of Amelia Earhart amd Charles Lindbergh; these famous pioneer aviators reinforced his love for aviation. Gomez built model airplanes in his youth, served in the US Navy as an Aviation Machinist Mate, First Class, and was a rated commercial pilot. He retired after 34 years with Eastern Airplnes in the maintenance department, 25 of those as Technical Supervisor. Gomez was an active member of Eastern&#39;s new aircraft specfication committee for most transport aircraft flying back in the day. Gomez attended the following technical aviation schools: 1)US Navy Aviation Mechanist Mate School, Norfolk, VA. 2)Sperry Gyro Auto-Pilot and Insturment School, Brooklyn, NY. 3)Sperry Gyro Auto-Pilot School for current aircraft, Phoenix, AZ. 4)Lockheed PV-1 Ventura and PV-2 Harpoon School, Burbank, CA. 5)Avex Aviation Flying School, Miami, FL. While at Eastern Airlines, Gomez was qualified to maintain the following aircraft: DC-3, DC-4, DC-6, DC-7, DC-8, DC-9, Lockheed COnstellation, Lockheed Electra II, Boeing 720, Boeing 727, A-300 Airbus, and the Martin 404. Leo was active in and a past president of the Florida Highlands CHapter 173 of the Air Force Association. During his working career, he received many awards from organizations including the prestigious Major Thomas B. McGuire Award for his contribution to the AFA and aviation. Co-Author, WALTER ROESSLER, at an early age, had the priviledge to fly with Clarence Chamberlain, the second American aviation to fly across the Atlantic after Linbergh&#39;s historic flight made on May 20-21, 1927. An avid model airplane builder, he attended and graduated from the Manhattan High School of Aviation Trades in New York City. He was also active as a Civil AIr Patrol Cadet during the early years of WWII. After graduation, he enlisted in the Army Air Corps and flew as an air crew member with the 334th Troop Carrier Squadron and the 24th Composite WIng of the 6th Air Force. Most if not all of his mission wewre over the Atlantic and Caribbean Sea. He maintained a crewed in DC-3, B-17, A-20, P-38, and AT-6 type aircraft, After his military discharge, Roessler attended the Academy of Aeronautica at Laguardia FIeld, LOng Island, New York. He was a rated aircraft mechanic and private pilot, and has been employed by the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation, Caribbean Atlantic AIrplnes, and West Indies Airways of Puerto Rico. He continued his Cicil AIr Patrol service with the 52nd Wing of Puerto Rico from 1949 to 1953 as a rated pilot and Cadet Training Officer. After retiring to Sebring, Florida, he was employed as an FBO (Fixed Base Operator) for two Highland County airports. He was also a past president of the Florida Highlands Chapter 173 of the Air Force Association. IN 1988, he was awarded the Matty Laird award for his contributions to the enhancement of avition in Highlands County.A must read for anyone seeking a solution to one of the 20th Century's most controversial mysteries---the disappearance of Amelia Earhart. ROessler and Gomez build their case, fact-by-fact, for a riveting account of exactly what happened." --Doris Rich, Author, Amelia Earhart--A Biography<br><br>Brilliant...fascinating...excellent...superb. I would certainly recommend this book to anyone...I believe Roessler and Gomez are right on track. --Gene Nora Jessen, Former VP of the 99s, Women's flying organization of which Amelia Earhart was the first president<br><br>The Earhart story was factual and very good. It contained all qualitative data. --Brig. Gen.

This was the first complete biography of Spinoza in any language and is based on detailed archival research. More than simply recounting the story of Spinoza&#39;s life, the book takes the reader right into the heart of Jewish Amsterdam in the seventeenth century and, with Spinoza&#39;s exile from Judaism, right into the midst of the tumultuous political, social, intellectual and religious world of the young Dutch Republic. Though the book will be an invaluable resource for philosophers, historians, and scholars of Jewish thought, it has been written for any member of the general reading public with a serious interest in philosophy, Jewish history, seventeenth-century European history, and the culture of the Dutch Golden Age. Spinoza: A Life has recently been awarded the Koret Jewish Book Award.</p><p>Remarkably, given his importance in Western philosophy, there has never been a substantial English-language biography of Baruch (or, as he was later known, Benedictus) Spinoza (1632-1677) until now. <i>Spinoza: A Life</i> makes up for the lack, delving into the archival records of 17th-century Amsterdam to flesh out Spinoza's world in rich detail. The subject himself doesn't even appear until the third chapter; Nadler first provides historical background on the treatment of Jews during the Spanish Inquisition and their eventual resettlement in the Dutch Republic. Later chapters explore Spinoza's relationship to the Jewish community and the possible reasons for his excommunication in 1656, as well as the emergence of his philosophical system. Academically rigorous without becoming ponderous, <i>Spinoza: A Life</i> is splendid both as biography and history, and a worthy introduction to Spinoza's philosophy.This was the first complete biography of Spinoza in any language and is based on detailed archival research. The book has been written for any member of the general reading public with a serious interest in philosophy, Jewish history, seventeenth-century European history, and the culture of the Dutch Golden Age.</p><h2>Environment: The Science Behind the Stories (5th Edition)</h2><p><b> <p>NOTE: This is the standalone book.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> </b> <p> <i>Environment: The Science behind the Stories, 5/e, </i>&nbsp;continues to revolutionize the environmental science course with integrated central case studies and real-life stories that provide you with a tangible and engaging framework for understanding science.

This new edition has been extensively updated throughout. Major structural changes include new chapters on Functional Heads and Head Movement and on Relativized Minimality. Discussions of a number of topics missing from or not paid due attention in the first edition have been integrated or expanded, for example: the structure of small clauses (in chaprer 2), chain formation (in chapter 6), and reconstruction, multiple movement, <i>wh</i>-absorption, Full Interpretation, and expletive replacement (in chapter 9).

This popularly-priced anthology contains the often taught Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl by Harriet Jacobs and the recently discovered A True Tale of Slavery by John S. Jacobs, her younger brother, now reprinted for the first time.<br> <p><br> </p> <p>After Harriet&#x2019;s owner, a physician, repeatedly abused her, she escaped his sexual advances for a time by entering into a relationship with a local attorney. Her owner continued to harass her, and she sought refuge in a crawlspace where she lived in hiding. After her escape to the North, she published her narrative.<br> </p> <p><br> </p> <p>John S. Jacobs &#x201c;walked away&#x201d; as he put it, from his owner, a congressman. He sailed on a whaling ship and educated himself. He then became a paid agent of the Anti-Slavery Society, made a lecturing trip with Frederick Douglass, and finally settled in London, where he remained until it was safe for a fugitive to return to the North. He wrote his story for a London Sunday school journal where it was published in 1861.</p>This Modern Library Paperback Classics edition combines the two most important African American slave narratives into one volume. <br>Frederick Douglass's Narrative, first published in 1845, is an enlightening and incendiary text. Born into slavery, Douglass became the preeminent spokesman for his people during his life; his narrative is an unparalleled account of the dehumanizing effects of slavery and Douglass's own triumph over it. Like Douglass, Harriet Jacobs was born into slavery, and in 1861 she published Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, now recognized as the most comprehensive antebellum slave narrative written by a woman. Jacobs's account broke the silence on the exploitation of African American female slaves, and it remains crucial reading. These narratives illuminate and inform each other.

Porter was of course prophetic, and the beginning was splendid. A Curtain of Green both introduced and established Eudora Welty as an instinctive genius of short fiction, and in this groundbreaking collection, which includes "Powerhouse" and "Keela, the Outcaste Indian Maiden," among other stories, are the first great works of a great American writer.<br><br>"To explain just why these stories impress one so appears as difficult as to define why an ordinary face, encountered by chance in the street, might suddenly reveal miraculous beauty, through a smile perhaps, or through an unexpected expression of sadness."--Original review of A Curtain of Green, November 16, 1941, by Marianne Hauser in the New York Times<br><br>"Miss Welty's short stories are deceptively simple.

Gogol's works remain popular with both writers and readers, who prize his originality, imaginative gifts, and sheer exuberance.<br>This collection offers an excellent introduction to the author's works. Opening a door to his bizarre world of broad comedy, fantasy, and social commentary, the title story portrays a petty official's mental disintegration as he struggles for the attention of the woman he loves. Set during the repressive rule of Nicholas I, it satirizes the bureaucratic excesses of the era. Additional tales include "The Nevski Prospect," a portrayal of the feverish pace of St. Petersburg street life, and "The Portrait," a gripping depiction of a soul's perdition.</p><p>Nikolai Vasilievich Gogol (1809-1852), although Russian, was born in the village of Sorochyntsi in the Poltava Oblast province of central Ukraine. He was never accepted by the Russian public as being completely Russian in his thinking and political ideology, and indeed he was not. Gogol&#39;s Ukrainian upbringing is most evident in his early works which draw heavily from Ukrainian culture and folk history. His later writing was more subversive, openly satirizing the corruption he saw rampant throughout Russia&#39;s empire. Gogol was homosexual. At age seventeen he wrote passionate letters to a friend who, being two years older, had graduated before Gogol, leaving him bereft. Gogol eventually exiled himself from Russia, living in Rome. It was here that he enjoyed at least one mutual love affair with a man, but his lover died within a year of their meeting. Two years later Gogol fell in love with the poet Nikolai Yazykov and penned love letters to him, but his efforts came to nothing. Gogol died in Moscow and was buried at Davilov Monastery. His last words were placed on his tombstone: &#34;And I shall laugh my bitter laugh.&#34; When Soviet authorities decided to demolish the monastery in 1931 and transfer Gogol&#39;s remains, it was discovered his body had been buried lying face down, leading some to wonder if he had been buried alive.The title loony, an obsessive petty bureaucrat, first saw the literary light of day in 1835, when his creator, Russia's first great fiction writer, was gaining his initial renown. Backed up by percussion instruments, Stephen Ouimette impersonates him here in a Stratford Festival staged reading, which was recorded by the CBC in Toronto. By and large, the story satirizes the officialdom of the time and place, but Ouimette, while doing his best with humor that has gotten a bit stale, chillingly plays his character's descent into madness. A fine performance.

It does so through two paths&#x2014;a book and a companion CD-ROM. The book gives a brief but comprehensive narrative of the Revolution. The CD-ROM offers readers an unprecedented multimedia overview of the Revolution through images, primary documents, and song. Together they introduce readers to the fascinating story of the world&#x2019;s first great revolution. </p><p>The book, written by Lynn Hunt and Jack Censer, preeminent authorities on the French Revolution, includes selected images and documents from the accompanying CD-ROM, prepared by the authors with the support of the Center for History and New Media at George Mason University and the American Social History Project at City University of New York. Features of the CD-ROM include primary documents (carefully chosen, translated, and placed in their proper historical contexts by a team of historians), songs, maps, and more than 300 images (caricatures, portraits, sculptures, and photographs of artifacts of material culture)&#x2014;many previously available only to specialists in the field. These hard-to-find images, gathered from repositories in France and the United States, comprise an unparalleled and powerful visual record of the Revolution.

Five centuries later, when Torquato Tasso began to search for a subject worthy of an epic, Jerusalem was governed by a sultan, Europe was in the crisis of religious division, and the Crusades were a nostalgic memory. Tasso turned to the First Crusade both as a subject that would test his poetic ambition and as a reflection on the quandaries of his own time. He sought to create a masterpiece that would deserve comparison with the great epics of the past.</p><p><i>Gerusalemme liberata</i> became one of the most widely read and cherished books of the Renaissance. First published in 1581, it was translated into English by Edward Fairfax in 1600. That translation has been the standard, even though Fairfax was only a good, not a great, poet. Fairfax tried to fit Tasso's verse into Spenserian stanzas, adding to and subtracting from the original and often changing Tasso's meaning.</p><p>Anthony Esolen's new translation captures the delight of Tasso's descriptions, the different voices of its cast of characters, the shadings between glory and tragedy&#x2015;and it does all this in an English as powerful and clear as Tasso's Italian. Tasso's masterpiece finally emerges as an English masterpiece.</p></p><p><p><b>Anthony Esolen </b> is a professor of English at Providence College.

This material is unique in that the subject is handled solely from the Biblical viewpoint. The author accepts the Bible as absolute truth and as infinitely superior to any human system of thinking. There has been no attempt to modify God&#39;s word to make it compatible with human philosophies, psychology, sociology, religious views, or public opinion. What the Bible Says About Child Training has been accepted by many Bible-believing churches as the standard text on child training since 1980. It has now been translated into seven foreign languages. This is a study designed to help parents to better understand their role and to reveal the mechanics for successfully raising children. To accomplish these ends this book will carefully define parental accountability, authority, and responsibility. It also describes the nature of a child and explains his Biblically-defined stages of development. With these principles firmly established, the book will present the Biblical system for training children. This system is divided into two distinct phases, controlling and teaching. The control phase is the establishment of the parents&#39; right of rulership over the will of the child. When parents can control their children, they have laid the necessary foundation for the fulfillment of the Biblical commandment for children to obey their parents. The teaching phase can only be accomplished by parents who have first trained their children to obey. This is because, before a child will receive the instructions of his parents, he must first respect their word; and before he will respect their word, he must first become obedient.</p><p>The following comments by the author are not intended to help sell his book, merely to give his opinion as to why this particular book has such complete opposite for and against reviews.You will readily see that the reviews on this book are extremely polarized between those who LOVE the book (5 stars) because it is faithful to the Bible and those who HATE it for the same reason. This should come as no surprise since Christ warned Christians that they should: "Beware lest anyone cheat you through philosophy and empty deceit, according to the tradition of men, according to the basic principles of the world, and not according to Christ." (Colossians 2:8) <p>Those who follow God's Word are warned in 1 John 3:13: "Do not marvel, my brethren, if the world hates you." Those who reject God's Word speak from their knowledge of the world philosophies (psychology and false religion) because: "They are of the world. Therefore they speak as of the world, and the world hears them. We are of God. He who knows God hears us; he who is not of God does not hear us. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error." (1 John 4:5-6) </p><p>Of course, some emotional or untaught Christians may also be deceived by these false philosophies and are thus warned in Colossians 2:8 to: "Beware lest anyone cheat you through philosophy and empty deceit, according to the tradition of men, according to the basic principles of the world, and not according to Christ." The consequences for these believers is graphically described in 2 Peter 2:18-22.</p></p><h2>Characteristics of Emotional and Behavioral Disorders of Children and Youth (10th Edition)</h2><p><p>The tenth edition of<i> Characteristics of Emotional and Behavioral Disorders of Children and Youth </i>follows the text's long-standing reputation for trusted research, a teacher-focused&nbsp; presentation, and clear explanations of the concepts related to students with&nbsp; EBD.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>Streamlined in this edition, the text offers a coherent conceptualization of the problems of students with emotional and behavioral disorders and the common challenges for teachers.

She is excited that her first book is &#34;The Handy Bible Answer Book.&#34; Ms. Prince lives in Fairview, North Carolina.What is the Bible?<br><br>The Bible is an anthology made up of 66 separate books. The books are grouped into the Old and New Testaments. Within those books there is history, law, prophecy, song, and poetry.<br><br>Why are Jews referred to by so many different names in the Bible?<br><br>Sometimes the Jews are referred to as Hebrews. Abraham was the first one to be referred to as a Hebrew. Most scholars think the word derives from the name Eber, who was one of Abraham&#x2019;s ancestors (Genesis 14: 13).The use of the name Hebrews set Abraham and his family apart. Sometimes Jews are referred to as Israelites. This term came in to use when God changed Jacob&#x2019;s name to Israel (Genesis 32: 28). The use of the name Israelite is the beginning of nationhood for Jacob and his family. When the Jews are referred to as Jews, they are designated as people from Judah.<br><br>What makes the Bible holy?<br><br>Christians believe that the content in the Bible was written and assembled by men, but that the whole process was led by God.<br><br>Who wrote the Bible?<br><br>The authorship of the Bible has a long, complex history going back thousands of years. For centuries, stories and songs were spread and passed down to succeeding generations by word of mouth. Authors include kings, prophets, fishermen, farmers, and others.<br><br>How old is the Bible?<br><br>Scholars continue to debate this. Some suggest that the oldest parts of the Old Testament were written in the 6th century BCE, though some say the oldest parts were written as early as the 14th century BCE.<br><br>Like the Old Testament, the New Testament was not written all at once. For generations, Christians used only the Hebrew Bible. It was not until the 2nd century CE that Christians began to set apart writings that were specifically Christian and treat them as equal to the Hebrew Scriptures.

New author Mary Warner Marien continues the text&#39;s tradition of combining outstanding scholarship with high quality art reproductions, while at the same time bringing a new contemporary voice to this classic text. FLEMING&#39;S ARTS and IDEAS challenges students to see the links between common purposes, themes, and ideas in painting, sculpture, architecture, literature, music, and philosophy.</p><p>Mary Warner Marien teaches at Syracuse University where she worked closely with William Fleming on the previous edition of ARTS and IDEAS. She is the author of numerous articles, book reviews, and essays on these and other subjects.

She recently completed PHOTOGRAPHY: A CULTURAL HISTORY (2002), a new survey of the history of photography, with special emphasis on contemporary global practice. Her current research project is an investigation of the women's movement in the late twentieth-century and its relationship to feminist art and art theory.<br><br>William Fleming became an associate professor of Fine Arts at Syracuse University in 1945. Feeling that the Humanities program at SU did not sufficiently serve the needs of a growing Fine Arts program, Fleming founded the Department of Fine Arts in 1947 and became its first chairman. He held this position until 1969. It was during this time that William Fleming authored ARTS and IDEAS. First published in 1955, this work served as the synthesis of music and art that Fleming had been so desperately seeking. In 1970, Fleming was named Centennial Professor of Fine Arts, for his outstanding leadership and contributions to his field. Upon his retirement from Syracuse University in 1975, he was named Centennial Professor Emeritus of Fine Arts."Fleming is the godfather of survey texts and is the standard by which all others are compared."<br><br>"Every page is a treasure of knowledge, filled with connections between the various fields of learning.

With essays by leading American and French critics, it provides a new interpretation of Degas' evolving conception of the nude, situating it in the subject's broader context among his peers in nineteenth-century France. It explores how Degas exploited all of the body's expressive possibilities, how his vision of the nude informed his notion of modernity, and how he abandoned the classical or historical form in favor of a figure seen in her own time and setting--whether engaged in overtly carnal acts or just stepping out of an ordinary bath. More than 200 lushly rendered full-color images present a re-seeing of Degas' subject in paintings, pastels, drawings, prints and sculpture. Among them are the most important of Degas' early paintings of nudes, <i>Scene of War in the Middle Ages</i>, which exerted a lifelong influence on the artist's treatment of the female nude and includes poses repeated throughout his career; monotypes of the late 1870s, almost caricature-like in their imagery, illustrating Degas' most explicitly sexual depictions of women in Parisian brothels; and a number of pictures portraying the daily life of women wherever they may reside. Together these iterations range over more than a half-century of genius achievement and present a groundbreaking look at the evolution of this master artist.</p><p></p><h2>Letters from the Light: An Afterlife Journal from the Self-Lighted World</h2><p>Including the original text and a new introduction telling how the book was discovered by the editor, a first-person account of life after death reveals what the author learned from a dead man through &#34;automatic writing.&#34; IP.</p><p></p><h2>Human Exceptionality: School, Community, and Family</h2><p>HUMAN EXCEPTIONALITY: SCHOOL, COMMUNITY, AND FAMILY, 12th Edition, is an evidence-based testament to the critical role of cross-professional collaboration in enhancing the lives of exceptional individuals and their families.

Beginning at the turn of the century, with the discovery of relativity and quantum mechanics, this second revolution has collapsed the elegant old Newtonian universe. Yet physicists have yet to complete a replacement, as they search for a grand unified theory. Now cosmologist Lee Smolin offers a startling new approach--a theory of the universe that is at once elegant, comprehensive, and radically different from anything proposed before.<br> In <em>The Life of the Cosmos</em>, Smolin cuts the Gordian knot of cosmology with a simple, powerful idea: "The underlying structure of our world," he writes, "is to be found in the logic of evolution." Today's physicists, he writes, have overturned Newton's view of the universe, yet they continue to cling to an understanding of reality not unlike Newton's own--as a clock, an intricate yet static mechanism. Smolin sees the very fabric of reality as changing and developing. "The laws of nature themselves," he argues, "like the biological species, may not be eternal categories, but rather the creations of natural processes occurring in time." A process of self organization like that of biologal evolution shapes the universe, as it develops and eventually reproduces through black holes, each of which may result in a new big bang and a new universe. Natural selection may guide the appearance of the laws of physics, favoring those universes which best reproduce. Smolin's ideas are based on recent developments in cosmology, quantum theory, relativity and string theory, yet they offer, at the same time, a completely new view of how these developments may fit together to form a new theory of cosmology. The result will be a cosmology according to which the fact that the universe is a home to life will be seen to be a natural consequence of the fundamental principles on which it has been built. This will be in direct contrast with the older point of view, coming from Newtonian physics, according to which the fact that the universe contains life, or any form of organization, is accidental. We exist in a universe filled with an array of beautiful structures ranging from the molecular organization of living things upwards to the galaxies, and science must ultimately explain why. In so doing, science will give us a picture of the universe in which, as the author writes, "the occurrence of novelty, indeed the perpetual birth of novelty, can be understood."<br> Lee Smolin is one of the leading cosmologists at work today, and he writes with an expertise and force of argument that will command attention throughout the world of physics. As startling as many of his ideas sound, each is subject to testing, and he includes several ideas on how they might be confirmed or disproved. Perhaps most important, however, is the humanity and sharp clarity of his prose, offering access for the layperson to the mind bending space at the forefront of today's physics.</p><p>Lee Smolin is not afraid to think big--really, really big. His theory of cosmic evolution by the natural selection of black-hole universes makes what we can experience into an infinitesimal, yet crucial, part of an ever-larger whole. Smolin says, &#34;the new view of the universe is light, in all its senses, because what Darwin has given us, and what we may aspire to generalize to the cosmos as a whole, is a way of thinking about the world which is scientific and mechanistic, but in which the occurrence of novelty--indeed, the perpetual birth of novelty--can be understood.&#34; Other scientists are, to say the least, divided on whether Smolin has much chance of being right, but they agree with Paul Davies that he is &#34;a deep and original thinker.&#34;<br><em>About the Author:</em><br> <strong>Lee Smolin</strong> is Professor of Physics at the Center for Gravitational Physics and Geometry at the Pennsylvania State University.

They include Tel Aviv&#x2019;s Levinsky Market, which houses a stall selling roasted seeds and nuts and a spice store that traffics in potions and powders reputed to &#x201c;drive away an evil eye, lift a curse, or help you find your soul mate.&#x201d; Dishes are equally intriguing: a chopped salad of avocado and kohlrabi highlights the country&#x2019;s abundant produce. Traditional selections and clever inventions intermingle, the latter exemplified by challah braided around mushrooms and za&#x2019;atar, and, in a chapter on stuffed items, a cake of cabbage leaves encasing a filling of pine nuts, almonds, pistachios, ground beef, and rice. A chapter on couscous includes a brace of stews for ladling over the pasta, as well as two options for creating couscous from scratch.

Fortunately, the ability to read law well (quickly and accurately) is a skill that can be acquired through knowledge and practice. The sooner the student masters these skills, the greater the rewards. Using seven specific reading strategies, reinforced with hands-on exercises at the end of each chapter, this book shows students how they can read law efficiently, effectively, powerfully, and confidently. Reading Like a Lawyer is divided into 3 parts: * Part I introduces the reader to the fundamentals of legal reasoning upon which law-based reading builds; * Part II introduces the reader to concrete strategies for reading effectively in law school; * and Part III teaches strategies for reading law outside of the law school context.</p><p>Ruth McKinney is a professor of law at University of North Carolina School of Law.Introduction Exceptional law students, and exceptional lawyers, are expert readers. From the first semester of law school, fledgling lawyers commonly read hundreds of pages of dense, challenging law in a week, and thousands of pages in a semester. Later, in practice, lawyers read statutes, cases, and administrative regulations every day, decoding the words in the texts and reaching behind the words to the many possible meanings that could be attributed to the law they&#x2019;re reading. Law students &#x2013; and lawyers &#x2013; who read law well are getting something from their reading that is not shared by those who read law less proficiently. Starting with the first days of class, what law students understand about the reading process itself has a major impact on how they read their assignments. How they read their assignments determines what they are able to get from those cases and statutes, what they are able to bring to class discussions and take from class discussions, and &#x2013; ultimately &#x2013; what they are able to learn for exams. How they read in law school, in turn, directs the path of their reading in the profession. Practicing lawyers who have developed sound reading practices in law school approach their analytical work with confidence, secure in the knowledge that they can read the law powerfully, passionately, and accurately. Put succinctly, these lawyers read with conviction, knowing they are reading like an expert. The good news is that the ability to read law like an expert is not a gift that you&#x2019;re either born with or lack from birth. Students and practitioners have not been separated into the sheep and the goats prior to entering law school, relegated forever to green pastures or rocky cliffs. Rather, reading law like an expert is a skill that can be acquired by everyone with the curiosity, determination, and flexibility to adapt their prior reading skills to this new setting &#x2013; and these skills can be acquired at any time. Once acquired and whenever acquired, the skill of reading law like an expert brings cascading rewards, enriching the reader&#x2019;s understanding of existing law and enhancing the reader&#x2019;s ability to create new paths to the law of the future. The purpose of this book is to teach you what the experts already know: how to read law-related material as efficiently, effectively, and powerfully as possible. There are three sections to the book: Part I introduces you to background information you need to know about the study and practice of law to get in the reading game. If you are already familiar with the structure of law school and the fundamentals of legal logic, you may choose to go directly to Part II. Part II focuses on casebook reading, the kind of reading that dominates the first years of law school. This second section introduces seven specific reading strategies, captured in the acronym E.M.P.O.W.E.R., that are common to all expert reading, and explores how law students can apply these strategies in the context of their casebook reading. Part III of the book moves outside of the casebook context, exploring how students and practitioners can read statutes and unedited cases accurately, confidently, and efficiently. There is a section of Appendices: Appendix A gives you a chance to test your baseline reading speed; Appendix B introduces a case-reading checklist that beginning students can use to develop healthy casebook reading habits; Appendix C introduces an advanced case-reading checklist to help successful students speed up their reading once they&#x2019;ve developed sound habits. Appendix D offers a reading list for those who would like to explore the topic of legal reading in greater depth.You will find useful supplementary material on that website, including some of the responses I thought about as I wrote the Practice Exercises at the end of each chapter. Comparing my responses to your own may help you gain confidence as you develop your legal reading skills. At their core, both law study and law practice are dependent on reading. If you learn to read law efficiently and effectively, you will be well on your way to achieving excellence in the study and practice of law. It is my hope that what you learn from this book will help get you started on the right page.</p><h2>Does the Center Hold?

Yet a definition of deaf people based on hearing loss obscures a wealth of ways in which societies have benefited from the significant contributions of deaf people. In this bold intervention into ongoing debates about disability and what it means to be human, experts from a variety of disciplines&#x2014;neuroscience, linguistics, bioethics, history, cultural studies, education, public policy, art, and architecture&#x2014;advance the concept of Deaf Gain and challenge assumptions about what is normal.</p><p>Through their in-depth articulation of Deaf Gain, the editors and authors of this pathbreaking volume approach deafness as a distinct way of being in the world, one which opens up perceptions, perspectives, and insights that are less common to the majority of hearing persons. For example, deaf individuals tend to have unique capabilities in spatial and facial recognition, peripheral processing, and the detection of images. And users of sign language, which neuroscientists have shown to be biologically equivalent to speech, contribute toward a robust range of creative expression and understanding. By framing deafness in terms of its intellectual, creative, and cultural benefits, <i>Deaf Gain</i> recognizes physical and cognitive difference as a vital aspect of human diversity.</p><p>Contributors: David Armstrong; Benjamin Bahan, Gallaudet U; Hansel Bauman, Gallaudet U; John D.

And what is their relation to practice? How can ethical judgment aspire to objectivity? The past two decades have witnessed a resurgence of interest in metaethics, placing questions such as these about the nature and status of ethical judgment at the very center of contemporary moral philosophy. <br> <em>Moral Discourse and Practice: Some Philosophical Approaches</em> is a unique anthology which collects important recent work, much of which is not easily available elsewhere, on core metaethical issues. Naturalist moral realism, once devastated by the charge of "naturalistic fallacy," has been reinvigorated, as have versions of moral realism that insist on the discontinuity between ethics and science. Irrealist, expressivist programs have also developed with great subtlety, encouraging the thought that a noncognivist account may actually be able to explain ethical judgments' aspirations to objectivity. Neo-Kantian constructivist theories have flourished as well, offering hope that morality can be grounded in a plausible conception of reasonable conduct. Together, the positions advanced in the essays collected here address these recent developments, constituting a rich array of approaches to contemporary moral philosophy's most fundamental debates. An extensive introduction by Darwall, Gibbard, and Railton is also included, making this volume the most comprehensive and up-to-date work of its kind. <em>Moral Discourse</em> is ideally suited for use in courses in contemporary ethics, ethical theory, and metaethics.<br></p><p>Stephen Darwall, Allan Gibbard, and Peter Railton are all at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor."An outstanding text for a graduate-level course on contemporary metaethics.

Doctor Watson, Mr Sherlock Holmes. The most famous introduction in the history of crime fiction takes place in Arthur Conan Doyle s A Study in Scarlet, bringing together Sherlock Holmes, the master of science detection, and John H. Watson, the great detective s faithful chronicler. This novel not only establishes the magic of the Holmes myth but also provides the reader with a dramatic adventure yarn which ranges from the foggy, gas-lit streets of London to the burning plains of Utah. The Sign of the Four, the second Holmes novel, presents the detective with one of his greatest challenges. The theft of the Agra treasure in India forms a catalyst for treachery, deceit and murder. With these two classic novels, A Study in Scarlet and The Sign of the Four, you have the brilliant foundation of the Sherlock Holmes canon.

They reflect the disillusioned world of the 1920s in which they were written, and he can be seen to take advantage of new, more open conventions in fiction. Suicide as a murder weapon and homosexual incest are some of the psychological tragedies whose consequences are unravelled by the mind of Holmes before the eyes of Watson. That said, the collection also includes some of the best turns of wit in the series, and indeed in the whole of English literature.</p><h2>The Prescriber&#39;s Guide</h2><p>Now established as the indispensable formulary in psychopharmacology, this latest edition of the Prescriber&#39;s Guide has been completely revised and updated to reflect the most current practice in the use of psychotropic drugs.

Invoking the Founding Fathers and ridiculing "losers" who could not pay their mortgages, Santelli called for "Tea Party" protests. Over the next two years, conservative activists took to the streets and airways, built hundreds of local Tea Party groups, and weighed in with votes and money to help right-wing Republicans win electoral victories in 2010.<br><br>In this penetrating new study, Harvard University's Theda Skocpol and Vanessa Williamson go beyond images of protesters in Colonial costumes to provide a nuanced portrait of the Tea Party. What they find is sometimes surprising. Drawing on grassroots interviews and visits to local meetings in several regions, they find that older, middle-class Tea Partiers mostly approve of Social Security, Medicare, and generous benefits for military veterans. Their opposition to "big government" entails reluctance to pay taxes to help people viewed as undeserving "freeloaders" - including immigrants, lower income earners, and the young. At the national level, Tea Party elites and funders leverage grassroots energy to further longstanding goals such as tax cuts for the wealthy, deregulation of business, and privatization of the very same Social Security and Medicare programs on which many grassroots Tea Partiers depend. Elites and grassroots are nevertheless united in hatred of Barack Obama and determination to push the Republican Party sharply to the right. <br><br><em>The Tea Party and the Remaking of Republican Conservatism</em> combines fine-grained portraits of local Tea Party members and chapters with an overarching analysis of the movement's rise, impact, and likely fate.</p><p><p></p> <b>Amazon Exclusive: Author Q &amp; A with Vanessa Williamson</b> <p></p> <table> <tbody><tr> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Vanessa Williamson</td> </tr> <tr> </tr> </tbody></table> <p></p> <p></p><b>Q.</b> How would you assess the importance of the web in helping to spread and sustain the Tea Party's messaging? <p></p><b>A.</b> The web has played a crucial role in helping organize what would otherwise be a relatively dispersed group of older, extremely conservative people. In fact, we suspect that those in the Tea Party, particularly the older members, became more Internet-savvy as a result of their Tea Party activity! But the Internet has also allowed for the spread of ideas that are sometimes far outside the mainstream of political discourse. Some of the more conspiratorial concerns we heard (for instance, about the need to revive the gold standard, about the imminent threat of martial law, about the dangers of modernizing the electric grid) occasionally appeared on Fox News or conservative talk radio, but largely survive online. <p></p><b>Q.</b> Who the "leaders" are of the Tea Party continues to be a subject of debate. Do you expect the Tea Party to ever have a centralized organizational structure? <p></p><b>A.</b> No. In our book, we discuss the Tea Party as the confluence of three long-standing strands of conservativism, which worked together in new ways in the first years of the Obama Administration. First, older, white, middle-class conservatives, many of whom had been previously involved in politics or local affairs, were demoralized after the electoral defeats of 2008, and looking for new leadership. Second, conservative media outlets, particularly Fox News and talk radio, helped mobilize and direct these grassroots conservatives. Third, long-standing extreme free-market advocacy groups, like Americans for Prosperity and FreedomWorks, took advantage of the new activism to build connections with grassroots conservatives and to push their agenda in Washington. These groups had similar goals in 2009 and 2010--revitalizing conservatism, derailing the Obama Administration's progressive agenda, and pushing the Republican Party to the right. But, as we discuss in the book, these groups do not always have the same policy goals, and in 2012, the Republican Party will have to appeal to moderates to win back the presidency. So it is unclear that the Tea Party label will continue to be a banner that these various conservative forces can rally behind. <p></p><b>Q.</b> Does the possibility exist for a split within the Republican Party? <p></p><b>A.</b> Not because of the Tea Party. There are always factions within a party, and the Tea Party supporters make up a major component of the Republican base. To the extent they are frustrated with the Republican Party, it is because they see the party as inadequately conservative, not because the Tea Party voters are political independents. <p></p><b>Q.</b> What differences do you foresee in the role of the Tea Party in the 2012 elections versus the role they played in 2010? <p></p><b>A.</b> First of all, Tea Party sympathizers will make up a far smaller portion of the electorate in 2012. Far fewer people vote in midterm elections, and those who do tend to be older, wealthier, and more conservative. In general elections, like 2012, we tend to see higher rates of turnout among the young and among minorities. So the influence of the Tea Party at the grassroots will be diluted. The elite aspects of the Tea Party, of course, will still be influence campaign contributors. And we are seeing the Tea Party play a role in the Republican primaries--a point we discuss in detail in our <i>New York Times</i> post ("Whose Tea Party Is It?," December 26, 2011).<br><strong>Theda Skocpol</strong> is the Victor S.

Through intimate conversations conducted over many years, <i>China Candid </i>provides an alternative history of the nation from its founding as a socialist state in 1949 up to the present. The voices of people who have lived under&#x2015;and often despite&#x2015;the Communist Party's rule give a compelling account of life in the maelstrom of China's economic reforms&#x2015;reforms that are being pursued by a system that remains politically rigid and authoritarian. Artists, politicians, businessmen and -women, former Red Guards, migrant workers, prostitutes, teachers, computer geeks, hustlers, and other citizens of contemporary China all speak with frankness and candor about the realities of the burgeoning power of East Asia, the China that will host the 2008 Olympics. Some discuss the corrosive changes that have been wrought on the professional ethics and attitudes of men and women long nurtured by the socialist state. Others recall chilling encounters with the police, the law courts, labor camps, and the army.

Though the two nations were allies, they found themselves at odds over just about every question, from who owned Saudi Arabia's oil to who should control the Suez Canal. Encouraging and exploiting widespread opposition to the British, the US intrigued its way to power--ultimately becoming as resented as the British had been.

Envy clouds thought, writes Joseph Epstein, clobbers generosity, precludes any hope of serenity, and ends in shriveling the heart. Of the seven deadly sins, he concludes, only envy is no fun at all. <br> Writing in a conversational, erudite, self-deprecating style that wears its learning lightly, Epstein takes us on a stimulating tour of the many faces of envy. He considers what great thinkers--such as John Rawls, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche--have written about envy; distinguishes between envy, yearning, jealousy, resentment, and schadenfreude ("a hardy perennial in the weedy garden of sour emotions"); and catalogs the many things that are enviable, including wealth, beauty, power, talent, knowledge and wisdom, extraordinary good luck, and youth (or as the title of Epstein's chapter on youth has it, "The Young, God Damn Them"). He looks at resentment in academia, where envy is mixed with snobbery, stirred by impotence, and played out against a background of cosmic injustice; and he offers a brilliant reading of <em>Othello</em> as a play more driven by Iago's envy than Othello's jealousy. He reveals that envy has a strong touch of malice behind it--the envious want to destroy the happiness of others. He suggests that envy of the astonishing success of Jews in Germany and Austria may have lurked behind the virulent anti-Semitism of the Nazis. <br> As he proved in his best-selling <em>Snobbery</em>, Joseph Epstein has an unmatched ability to highlight our failings in a way that is thoughtful, provocative, and entertaining. If envy is no fun, Epstein's <em>Envy</em> is truly a joy to read.<br></p><p><br><strong>Joseph Epstein</strong> is the author of eighteen books, including <em>Snobbery: The American Version</em>, which was a <em>New York Times</em> Best Seller and Notable Book for 2002.

In it, Michael Mann identifies the four principal &#39;sources&#39; of power as being control over economic, ideological, military, and political resources. He examines the interrelations between these in a narrative history of power from Neolithic times, through ancient Near Eastern civilisations, the classical Mediterranean age, and medieval Europe, up to just before the Industrial Revolution in England. Rejecting the conventional monolithic concept of a &#39;society&#39;, Dr. Mann&#39;s model is instead one of a series of overlapping, intersecting power networks. He makes this model operational by focusing on the logistics of power - how the flow of information, manpower, and goods is controlled over social and geographical space-thereby clarifying many of the &#39;great debates&#39; in sociological theory. The present volume offers explanations of the emergence of the state and social stratification.</p><p>This study of the nature of power in human societies identifies the four principal &#34;sources&#34; of power as being control over economic, ideological, military and political resources.

Gorski, Contemporary Sociology</p><h2>The Betrothed: Introduction by Jonathan Keates (Everyman&#39;s Library Classics Series)</h2><p>Italy&#x2019;s greatest novel and a masterpiece of world literature, <i>The Betrothed </i>chronicles the unforgettable romance of Renzo and Lucia, who endure tyranny, war, famine, and plague to be together.<br><br>Published in 1827 but set two centuries earlier, against the tumultuous backdrop of seventeenth-century Lombardy during the Thirty Years&#x2019; War, <i>The Betrothed</i> is the story of two peasant lovers who want nothing more than to marry. Their region of northern Italy is under Spanish occupation, and when the vicious Spaniard Don Rodrigo blocks their union in an attempt to take Lucia for himself, the couple must struggle to persevere against his plots&#x2014;which include false charges against Renzo and the kidnapping of Lucia by a robber baron called the Unnamed&#x2014;while beset by the hazards of war, bread riots, and a terrifying outbreak of bubonic plague. First and foremost a love story, the novel also weaves issues of faith, justice, power, and truth into a sweeping epic in the tradition of <i>Ivanhoe,</i> <i>Les Mis�rables,</i> and <i>War and Peace.</i> Groundbreakingly populist in its day and hugely influential to succeeding generations, Alessandro Manzoni&#x2019;s masterwork has long been considered one of Italy&#x2019;s national treasures.<br><br>Translated by Archibald Colquhoun</p><p>ALESSANDRO MANZONI, a revered poet, novelist, and statesman, was born in Milan in 1785 and died in 1873. His masterpiece, I promessi sposi--The Betrothed--was groundbreaking for replacing conventional antiquated rhetorical forms with expressive and accessible prose. His innovative style won him a broad audience and powerfully influenced the Italian writers who succeeded him. <br><br>About the Introducer: JONATHAN KEATES's works include the short story collection <i>Allegro Postillions</i> and the novel <i>The Stranger's Gallery</i>.

In 1940 he became acting director of the British Institute in Naples and served as an intelligence officer during the war. He translated Giuseppi di Lampedusa's masterpiece, <i>The Leopard</i>, for Everyman's, and in 1954 wrote a biography of Manzoni.<i>Excerpted from the introduction</i><br>In the summer of 1940 the Dante scholar and Cambridge research fellow Uberto Limentani found himself joining over a thousand so-called &#x2018;enemy aliens&#x2019; being deported from Britain to Canada on the converted cruise liner Arandora Star. Victims of Winston Churchill&#x2019;s notoriously ill-judged order to &#x2018;collar the lot&#x2019;, they included, alongside German prisoners of war, a handful of spies and a small number of genuine sympathizers with Hitler and Mussolini, a larger contingent consisting of Jewish refugees, who had sought a haven in the United Kingdom from the extermination threatening them in continental Europe. Limentani, himself a Jew and among those persecuted under Mussolini&#x2019;s 1938 racial decrees, had been welcomed in Cambridge, where his work on Dante was already well known.<br><br>Off the west coast of Ireland, on the first leg of its voyage to Canada, the Arandora Star was torpedoed by a German U-boat. While a few passengers were able to take to the lifeboats, others like Uberto Limentani jumped from the sinking ship into the sea, but over five hundred among the deportees were drowned. Years later, someone asked the Serena Professor of Italian, as he had by then become, how he managed to survive.<br>I began reciting a poem to myself, Alessandro Manzoni&#x2019;s ode on the death of Napoleon Bonaparte, Il Cinque Maggio [The Fifth of May] which they made me learn at school in Italy. When I reached a certain line I realized something was wrong. Had I left something out, mistaken a word or muddled the syntax? As I trod water, waiting for a rescue if it should ever come, I thought &#x2018;I&#x2019;ll look up the text when I get back to Cambridge and check the reference.&#x2019; That was what kept me going. An hour or so later we were pulled out of the sea.<br><br>The poem which, however indirectly, contributed to Limentani&#x2019;s survival is the work of the only Italian literary figure whom his countrymen consider worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as Dante. In his own lifetime Alessandro Manzoni (1785&#x2013;1873) earned for himself a degree of respect most writers would envy, the kind of reverence normally accorded to champions of national freedom, transcendent spiritual leaders or major pioneers of social reform. When he died at the age of eighty-nine, a day of national mourning was declared throughout Italy. Schools and universities were closed and theatres kept dark. A massive funeral cort�ge wound through the streets of Manzoni&#x2019;s native Milan, headed by a troop of cavalry, with government ministers and members of the Italian royal family walking behind the coffin. A year later Giuseppe Verdi, who had declared after meeting him, &#x2018;I could have fallen to my knees if it were permissible to worship a human being&#x2019;, dedicated his magnificent setting of the Requiem to Manzoni&#x2019;s memory.<br><br>Nothing since then has served to devalue the writer&#x2019;s classic status. His modest oeuvre &#x2013; a handful of poems, a brace of tragedies, a historical essay, a religious treatise and a single novel &#x2013; is held sacred, not simply among academics who study it for a living or by teachers of high-school literature courses, but by those many Italians who otherwise show no special interest in reading. Most writers can expect to undergo some sort of posthumous re-evaluation, but this has never really happened in the case of Manzoni. Critical regard has remained more or less constant, though the angle of scrutiny has shifted over the years according to the prevailing aesthetic.<br><br>To a significant extent this is due to our awareness, as readers, of the deep personal integrity which appears to characterize his attitude to the very act of committing himself to paper. Writing, for Manzoni, was a moral gesture and an engagement with literature was part of his birthright as a child of the Milanese Enlightenment in the closing decades of the eighteenth century. His maternal grandfather was Cesare Beccaria, whose indolent brilliance took wing in works on penal reform and economic theory which earned the admiration of the French philosophes and made him an inspiration for the Founding Fathers of the American constitution. Little Alessandro himself may in fact have been the son, not of dull, mediocre Count Pietro Manzoni but of the far livelier Giovanni Verri, whose family dominated the intellectual life of Milan. Bored from the outset with her elderly husband, Donna Giulia Manzoni soon took off to Paris with another Milanese illuminato, Carlo Imbonati, leaving her son, for the time being, at the dreary mountain boarding school to which his quarrelling parents had thoughtfully despatched him.<br>&nbsp;<br>When eventually, in 1805, Manzoni, aged twenty, was able to join his mother in Paris, the impact on him of &#x2018;this dear France, alight with such genius and so many virtues&#x2019; was profound and enduring. At the brilliant salon of Mme Sophie Condorcet, he was befriended by her lover, the philosopher Claude Fauriel, who remained a valued friend and intellectual sounding-board for the rest of his life. Even more than Fauriel&#x2019;s inexhaustible Gallic esprit, Manzoni valued his &#x2018;most amiable and virtuous heart&#x2019;. The emphasis on virtue and sincerity was a typical aspect of the Romantic cult of friendship, but it was still more characteristic of Manzoni himself, ill at ease in the brittle, cynical, libertine world of the Italy he had left behind. It was Fauriel who taught him to sift what he read and heard for its fundamental elements of truth, to be unafraid of complexities and remain wary of simple answers. In many respects his was the most crucial influence on Manzoni, whether as an artist or an individual, and it explains, to an important extent, the writer&#x2019;s essential self-restraint and fastidiousness in the approach to his m�tier.<br><br>Typically, when he began looking for a wife, Alessandro&#x2019;s list of priorities was headed by straightforwardness, simplicity, tolerance and good sense. In addition, she would have to cope with her husband&#x2019;s instinctive shyness, tendency to selfeffacement and love of being alone. Such a paragon, more swiftly than expected, came to hand in Henriette Blondel, daughter of a Swiss banker, brought up as a Calvinist, whom he married in her parents&#x2019; drawing room in Milan in 1808. Resourceful and strong-willed, Henriette kept her distance, on a bridal visit to her mother-in-law in Paris, from Donna Giulia&#x2019;s sophisticated circle of journalists and litte &#x301;rateurs. Instead she began to turn away from Protestantism in favour of that liberal Catholic spirituality evolving in the wake of the French Revolution&#x2019;s assault on the hierarchy and entrenched privileges of the old religious establishment.<br><br>By degrees Henriette carried her husband with her. Officially raised a Catholic, Manzoni had never taken religion seriously, so that when, two years after their marriage, he found himself undergoing a crisis of faith alongside his wife, this assumed the nature of a Damascene conversion quite as dramatic, in its own way, as any experienced by St Paul. The pair of them, with their infant daughter Giulietta, promptly left Paris to seek the tranquillity of the Lombard villa at Brusuglio, in the Brianza district north-east of Milan, which had been bequeathed to Manzoni by his mother&#x2019;s lover Carlo Imbonati. Nowadays the whole area is heavily urbanized, a dormitory zone, amid its motorways and factories, for Italy&#x2019;s northern metropolis. In the early nineteenth century it offered, by contrast, precisely the kind of rural retreat from a noisy world, dominated at that time by Napoleon Bonaparte at his most imperially hubristic, in which Alessandro and Henriette, natural idealists, could live according to their shared Christian principles and bring up a growing family. Though he returned briefly to Paris in 1819, it was at Brusuglio and in Milan itself that Manzoni&#x2019;s career as a poet, playwright and novelist would be firmly anchored.<br><br>Early success arrived for him with the Inni Sacri [Sacred Hymns] (1812&#x2013;15), a sequence of five poems inspired by religious festivals and fusing modern ideals of freedom and equality with basic Christian concepts of compassion and universal redemption. Stendhal, hardly noted for his Catholic piety, was among those who commended the poet&#x2019;s humane sincerity of utterance, while Goethe, praising their lack of sectarian animus or fanatical piety, instantly became one of Manzoni&#x2019;s most dedicated international admirers. When, a few years later, Il Conte di Carmagnola, the first of his two verse tragedies, was damned by Italian critics and received equally dusty notices in English reviews like the Quarterly and the Westminster, Goethe was vocal in praise of its author as &#x2018;a dear and worthy young man&#x2019;.<br><br>What fascinated the older writer from a technical aspect was Manzoni&#x2019;s determination to make his characters, both in Il Conte di Carmagnola and in its successor Adelchi, entirely credible human beings as regarded their personal motivation and the interaction with those around them. Each play was a historical drama and the dramatist&#x2019;s basic materials were confined to the stark, limited, fragmentary details afforded him by medieval chroniclers yet, as Goethe perceived, Manzoni always made his dramatis personae plausible in the context of their own social and political backgrounds. It was this particular gift which he was now ready to put to momentous account in an entirely different literary genre, one in which he had never worked before.<br><br>Though the tradition of modern European fiction, as practised by writers since the seventeenth century, claims an important line of descent from the medieval and Renaissance Italian story collections known as novelle, there was no such phenomenon in Manzoni&#x2019;s time as &#x2018;the Italian novel&#x2019;. The extended fictional works published in Italy during the nineteenth century&#x2019;s opening decades almost all arrived as translations from other languages and the market for such books during the 1820s was dominated by Sir Walter Scott. His achievement in works like Waverley, Old Mortality and The Bride of Lammermoor lay in shaping a new species of novel, whose plot centred on the impact of cataclysmic events during different historical epochs on the lives of ordinary individuals, their families and their social communities. No other writer had exerted such a potent influence on the fiction of his era. In the ten years following Waverley&#x2019;s publication in 1815, Scott effectively re-orientated the relationship between novelists and their reading public throughout Europe and America and vastly extended the range and significance of his chosen medium.<br><br>One of his shrewdest and most enthusiastic readers was Alessandro Manzoni, who wrote excitedly to Fauriel in the summer of 1822 with the news that he himself had started work on a story set in seventeenth-century Lombardy. With the working title Fermo e Lucia, this was the earliest form of the novel which became first of all Gli Sposi Promessi and then I Promessi Sposi. Its author was conscious from the outset that he was engaged in a momentous personal experiment. The challenges involved were those of assembling a large-scale fictional work dealing with the interplay of conflicting socio-historical forces and with the various ways in which these affected a group of people very unlike the upper-class intellectual echelon in which he had spent most of his life so far. It was clearly thrilling for Manzoni, as somebody with a self-confessed &#x2018;genuine desire that I should be seen as a major author&#x2019;, to realize that he was creating a new art form within a national literary tradition that had so far turned its back on novel-writing as a serious pursuit.<br><br>Manzoni&#x2019;s initial inspiration was a forgotten law, reprinted for whatever reason in a recent textbook of political economy, threatening sanctions against any priest who refused to perform a marriage ceremony. It belonged to a period during the 1620s when Lombardy lay under Spanish rule and there was widespread resentment among the local peasantry against the arrogance, greed and petty exactions of their alien rulers. These were years, what was more, of bad harvests and crippling food shortages throughout northern Italy, with accompanying plague epidemics in cities and rural areas. Additional unrest was created by the presence of armies involved in the desultory warfare between Italian states and the overspill of conflict from the Thirty Years&#x2019; War beyond the Alps into the fertile Lombard plains between the mountains and the River Po.<br><br>Against this troubled background the story of Renzo and Lucia, the betrothed lovers of the book&#x2019;s title, unfolds as their intended marriage is thwarted by the sinister manoeuvres of the local grandee, Don Rodrigo, whose team of armed bravoes terrorize the weak-kneed priest Don Abbondio into obstructing the match. It is the very absence of anything specifically heroic in the presentation of Renzo and Lucia which makes their adventures &#x2013; and the novel&#x2019;s structural basis is that of an adventure story &#x2013; so compelling. Among the lessons Manzoni learned from Scott (who had in his turn picked it up from eighteenth-century novelists like Fielding and Smollett) is that this sort of narrative engages the reader more effectively through its qualities of the haphazard and the accidental. We enjoy it the better because we know that, like most people, its central figures have no assets beyond a smattering of grit, resilience and optimism with which to confront both the forces of circumstance and those historical imperatives eternally threatening to crush them.</p><h2>Global Englishes: A Resource Book for Students (Routledge English Language Introductions)</h2><p><p><strong><em>Routledge English Language Introductions</em></strong> cover core areas of language study and are one-stop resources for students.</p> <p>Assuming no prior knowledge, books in the series offer an accessible overview of the subject, with activities, study questions, sample analyses, commentaries, and key readings &#x2013; all in the same volume.

Certainly there is nothing wrong with this. In fact, both of us make allusions to such work in our respective sections of the book. However, we thought it might be more useful for the aspiring writer to have a book more closely modeled after the creative writing workshop wherein the students read and critique work of their peers in an effort to discover what is working in a story or in a poem and what is not working, and thereby apply these lessons to their own work. </p><p> The book is organized by genre with each respective genre organized by chapters defining the elements of fiction and poetry, followed by the workshop sections wherein student stories and poems are presented. </p><p> In the chapters covering the elements of fiction and poetry, we have presented utilitarian definitions for the reader followed by essays by guest writers. For example, in the chapter on Sound in Poetry, we present a definition of that element followed by an essay on sound by Alberto Rios who addresses the quality of sound in his own students' work. In the fiction section of this book, we define the various uses of setting in the chapter so-named. Following this definition is an essay by the novelist Valerie Miner who writes about the role of setting in her own student's story. </p><p> In the workshop sections of the book, we present first the student poem and student story without marginalia, followed by questions the reader is asked to consider. Following this is the same story and the same poem, this time with our marginalia and then our critiques of the student work. Finally, student revisions are presented with critiques. </p><p> It is our hope that the structure of this book will allow the readers to witness the creative evolution of poems and stories, and that they will see the process of writing as inherently dynamic as the writers go through draft after draft in the effort of crafting the finest fiction and poetry they are capable of. Whether used by a student-writer in a creative writing class or by a student-writer at home alone, this book will serve as a guide to steer through sometimes rough and unsure waters until the writer is safely moored against the tide.

Stressing the importance of the single sentence, The Paramedic Method of revision provides an easily learned method of revision to combat the obscurities of meaning that plague The Official Style, and demonstrates how to revise this stilted, dense prose into plain English. This book has been used with success wherever extensive writing is required, and also at every level of higher education. <b> </b> Addresses the specific stylistic patterns that characterize most bad writing and gives an eight-step revision method called The Paramedic Method to break those patterns and improve writing. Helps with writing tasks in business, government, and the university, where The Official Style is rampant, and provides an indispensable guide to revising in every writing context. <b> </b> For anyone interested in revising, specifically at the sentence level.</p><p>University of California, Los Angeles</p><h2>Lessons of Disaster: Policy Change after Catastrophic Events (American Government and Public Policy)</h2><p>Even before the wreckage of a disaster is cleared, one question is foremost in the minds of the public: "What can be done to prevent this from happening again?" Today, news media and policymakers often invoke the "lessons of September 11" and the "lessons of Hurricane Katrina." Certainly, these unexpected events heightened awareness about problems that might have contributed to or worsened the disasters, particularly about gaps in preparation. Inquiries and investigations are made that claim that "lessons" were "learned" from a disaster, leading us to assume that we will be more ready the next time a similar threat looms, and that our government will put in place measures to protect us. <br><br>In <i>Lessons of Disaster</i>, Thomas Birkland takes a critical look at this assumption. We know that disasters play a role in setting policy agendas&#x2015;in getting policymakers to think about problems&#x2015;but does our government always take the next step and enact new legislation or regulations? To determine when and how a catastrophic event serves as a catalyst for true policy change, the author examines four categories of disasters: aviation security, homeland security, earthquakes, and hurricanes. He explores lessons learned from each, focusing on three types of policy change: change in the larger social construction of the issues surrounding the disaster; instrumental change, in which laws and regulations are made; and political change, in which alliances are created and shifted. <br><br>Birkland argues that the type of disaster affects the types of lessons learned from it, and that certain conditions are necessary to translate awareness into new policy, including media attention, salience for a large portion of the public, the existence of advocacy groups for the issue, and the preexistence of policy ideas that can be drawn upon. <br><br>This timely study concludes with a discussion of the interplay of multiple disasters, focusing on the initial government response to Hurricane Katrina and the negative effect the September 11 catastrophe seems to have had on reaction to that tragedy.</p><p><b>Thomas A. Birkland</b> is the William T. Kretzer Professor of Public Policy in the School of Public and International Affairs at North Carolina State University. He is the author of <i>After Disaster: Agenda Setting, Public Policy, and Focusing Events</i>.<p>"Government is not perfect; we all know that. But governments can and do learn. When policies clearly fail, as happened in the 9/11 terrorist attacks, as has occurred with various responses to hurricanes, earthquakes, and aviation security disasters, what happens next? Learning is by no means automatic; groups of affected citizens must mobilize; new ideas must be tossed around and considered; and a consensus must be reached about new policy initiatives. This does not always occur, and governments often do not learn anything even from terrible failures. In this very readable book based on several case studies including public response to the events of 9/11, Birkland shows us how governments draw important lessons from past failures. The book is a useful corrective to complaints that policy failures are there for all to see, but improvements never occur; Birkland shows that governments do, indeed, learn. More importantly, he helps us understand how we might make them learn more."&#x2015;Frank R. Baumgartner, Distinguished Professor of Political Science, The Pennsylvania State University</p><p>"Birkland analyzes an understudied topic: the extent to which governments learn after critical events. Often 'event-induced attention' causes policy change, but does this result in policy learning, or do governments simply repeat past errors? In framing an interesting question, and in ably utilizing four case studies to study it, Birkland has written an important book."&#x2015;Bryan Jones, Donald R. Matthews Distinguished Professor of American Politics, director, Center for American Politics and Public Policy, University of Washington, Seattle</p><p>"This book is a useful companion to <i>After Disaster</i>. Both books look at focusing events like natural disasters, but this also examines the ultimate focusing event (9-11) and whether subsequent bureaucratic change produced meaningful policy change."&#x2015;Roger W. Cobb, Brown University</p></p><h2>Advocacy Practice for Social Justice, Second Edition</h2><p>Social justice is one of the six core values of the social work profession as defined in the NASW Code of Ethics. Professor Hoefer demonstrates that advocacy is a key tool in achieving social justice at all levels of practice, and he argues that social workers have an obligation not only to actively advocate but to empower others to do so as well. Using evidence-based information, anecdotes, case studies, and his own personal experiences, Professor Hoefer presents the ethical imperative for advocacy.<br><br>Advocacy Practice for Social Justice shows that rather than being an ancillary or subordinate practice within an existing social work practice, the process of advocating is composed of basic steps familiar to all social workers in generalist practice. Successful advocacy begins with establishing a relationship with the client, continues with the creation and implementation of a plan of action, and ends with short- and long-term evaluation. The author s clear step-by-step design acts as a blueprint for advocacy that can be incorporated into any existing practice. <br><br>The new edition of this book is updated and expanded to emphasize the crucial nature of advocacy in modern social work practice.</p><p>Richard Hoefer (MSW, University of Kansas; PhD, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor) is the Roy E. Dulak Professor for Community Research in the School of Social Work at the University of Texas at Arlington. He has been at UTA since 1992, publishing frequently and teaching how to conduct advocacy, evaluate programs, and administer and manage nonprofit organizations. His goal is to provide information to assist nonprofit leaders and social workers in becoming better at their jobs. Professor Hoefer is an award-winning professor, a member of the National Association of Social Workers, the Council on Social Work Education ,and the Association for Research on Nonprofit Organizations and Voluntary Action.[The book] creatively and thoughtfully communicates the nature of advocacy practice, and the ways that advocacy practice aligns with and diverges from traditional direct practice. For those who have not yet realized that advocacy practice is indeed social work practice, this is the beginning of a journey toward the inevitable.&#34; -Heather Kanenberg, Journal of Baccalaureate Social Work, Vol. 17 (2012)</p><h2>A Passage to India: A Norton Critical Edition (Norton Critical Editions)</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;<em>A Passage to India</em> is one of the greatest modern novels about empire.

These factors remain critical, especially given today&#x2019;s unprecedented business climate. But Rich Karlgaard&#x2015;Forbes publisher, entrepreneur, investor, and board director&#x2015;takes a surprising turn and argues that there is now a third element that&#x2019;s required for competitive advantage. It fosters innovation, it accelerates strategy and execution, and it cannot be copied or bought. It is found in a perhaps surprising place&#x2015;your company&#x2019;s values.</p> <p>Karlgaard examined a variety of enduring companies and found that they have one thing in common; all have leveraged their deepest values alongside strategy and execution, allowing them to fuel growth as well as weather hard times. Karlgaard shares these stories and identifies the five key variables that make up every organization&#x2019;s &#x201c;soft edge&#x201d;:</p> <ul> <li><b>Trust:</b> Northwestern Mutual has built a $25 million dollar revenue juggernaut on trust, the foundation of lasting success. Learn how to create an environment that engenders trust and propels high performance.</li> <li><b>Smarts:</b> In most technical fields your formal education quickly becomes out of date. How do you keep up? Learn how the Mayo Clinic, Stanford University women&#x2019;s basketball team, and others stay on top by relentlessly pursuing an advantage through smarts.</li> <li><b>Teamwork:</b> Since collaboration and innovation are a must in the global economy, effective teamwork is vital. Learn how global giant FedEx stays focused and how nimble Nest Labs relies on lean teams with cognitive diversity.</li> <li><b>Taste:</b> Clever product design and integration are proxies for intelligence because they make customers feel smart. But taste goes further into deep emotional engagement. Specialized Bicycles calls it &#x201c;the elusive spot between data truth and human truth.&#x201d; How can you consistently make products or services that trigger these emotional touch points?</li> <li><b>Story:</b> Companies that achieve lasting success have an enduring and emotionally appealing story. What&#x2019;s your company&#x2019;s story? How do you tell it <i>your</i> way? Gain the ability to create a powerful narrative in a world where outsiders often exercise the louder voice.</li> </ul></p><p>Rich Karlgaard <p><b></b></p> <b>Rich Karlgaard Q&amp;A for <i>The Soft Edge</i></b> <p></p> <p><b></b></p> <b><i>The Soft Edge</i> seems to tie into many of the trending themes in business these days (ie the power of culture, values, emotional intelligence. ) Is it a choice for business leaders, or a requirement?</b> <p></p> <p>It&#x2019;s always a choice. I&#x2019;ve seen companies succeed in the short term with a great strategy and flawless execution. If you want to build a company to flip, perhaps you can ignore the soft edge. But companies that last, that survive disruptions, and that fight off economic headwinds, go deeper than just strategy and execution. They find their endurance in soft edge values &#x2013; trust, smarts, teams, taste, stories. Their employees are committed and their customers are loyal.</p> <p><b></b></p> <b>As a publisher of one of the most respected business magazines what is something you feel most people don&#x2019;t understand about being successful?</b> <p></p> <p>The founder of Forbes, B. C. Forbes, wrote this in the very first issue in 1917. &#x201c;Business was originated to produce happiness, not pile up riches. &#x201d; This was a warning! Not all success takes you where you want to go. The companies I profiled in <i>The Soft Edge</i> were happy places and super successful. The leadership was highly regarded by employees precisely because the leaders had built and nourished cultures that brought out the best in people. This is what creates lasting success.</p> <br> <p><b></b></p> <b>Of all the companies or people you talked to &#x2013; who stood out to you the most?</b> <p></p> <p>Two companies really surprised me. One was Northwestern Mutual, the $25 billion insurance giant. The last thing I could ever do is wake up each morning, get on the phone, and sell insurance. I just couldn&#x2019;t do it. But Northwestern Mutual&#x2019;s reps do it with a sense of joy and purpose. The other company is Specialized Bicycles. The chief designer told me his goal, in building some of the world&#x2019;s best racing bikes, was to find &#x201c;the sweet spot between data truth and human truth.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s a great line and a noble aspiration. It&#x2019;s what every company should seek. </p> <p><b></b></p> <b>Can you hire to improve your Soft Edge? Alternatively, are their ways businesses are sabotaging themselves unknowingly? </b> <p></p> <p>When it comes to hiring, two major findings in <i>The Soft Edge</i> are the importance of grit and of cognitive diversity. On grit, you want to hire people that have surmounted big challenges in their lives. Northwestern Mutual likes to hire military veterans. Specialized likes designers who have built things with their hands. They like salespeople who&#x2019;ve suffered a 100-mile ride in sleet. On cognitive diversity, Nest Labs puts geeks and artists in same room when products are being designed. SAS Institute likes data analysts with backgrounds in music and art. </p> <p><b></b></p> <b>Out of the five things that make up <i>The Soft Edge</i> &#x2013; which is the most important? </b> <p></p> <p>Trust is the foundational soft edge. It has two components: External trust is whether your customers, suppliers, investors and shareholders trust you. Internal trust is whether your employees trust you. If you fail to engender trust in either area, your company will have problems that will not fix themselves. In a knowledge economy, trust is huge. No company can forcibly pull ideas out of employees heads, and employees will not give their best ideas to leaders or colleagues they don&#x2019;t trust. </p> <p><b></b></p> <b>Tell me something that you didn&#x2019;t put in the book and you wish you had. </b> <p></p> <p>I wish I had linked soft edge excellence to long-term investment strategy. I ran out of time to do the research. But anecdotally, it is there. Warren Buffett is famous for buying shares in great companies when their stock prices are low. We all understand a low price. But what, in Buffett&#x2019;s mind, is a great company? It turns out that most of Buffett&#x2019;s investments are in companies that display soft edge excellence in addition to clever strategy and flawless execution.</p><p><b>PRAISE FOR <i>THE SOFT EDGE</i></b></p> <p>&#x201c;Entertaining, magnificent, enlightening, and so relevant to the future.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2015;VIVEK WADHWA</b>, vice president of research and innovation, Singularity University; fellow, Stanford University&#x2019;s Center for Corporate Governance; research director, Duke University&#x2019;s Center for Entrepreneurship and Research Commercialization</p> <p>&#x201c;The great irony of our age is this: the faster technology progresses, the more crucial it is to organize around timeless human truths.

The discovery of the scrolls has added dramatically to our understanding of the varieties of Judaism at the time of Jesus and the rise of Christianity, but has also prompted heated debate about the nature of these religions. As the monumental task of transcribing and translating the Dead Sea Scrolls is finally completed, people around the world are taking stock of the significance of these ancient documents. In this book, two of the world's leading experts on the scrolls reveal the complete and fascinating story in all its detail: the amazing discovery, the intense controversies, and the significant revelations.</p><p>Drawing together all the evidence, this timely book explores:</p><ul> <li> The discovery and dating of the scrolls</li> <li> Their relationship to the Hebrew Bible, Apocrypha, and New Testament</li> <li> Their messianic and apocalyptic messages</li> <li> The identity, nature, and theology of the Qumran community</li> <li> The nonbiblical scrolls</li> <li> Controversies surrounding the scrolls</li></ul><p>This comprehensive, up-to-date guide is the definitive introduction to all aspects of the scrolls, including their teachings, the community that created them, the world of Judaism, the origins of Christianity, our understanding of Jesus and the New Testament. Featuring photos of the original texts, the sites, and the scholars who deciphered them, and including illustrative passages from the scrolls, <em>The Meaning of the Dead Sea Scrolls</em> presents the most complete and accurate scholarship on the Dead Sea Scrolls available today.</p></p><p><p>James VanderKam, John A. O'Brien Professor of Hebrew Scriptures in the Department of Theology at the University of Notre Dame, is the author of <em>The Dead Sea Scrolls Today.</em></p><br><br><p>Peter Flint is co-director of the Dead Sea Scrolls Institute at Trinity Western University in British Columbia. He is the author of <em>The Dead Sea Psalms Scrolls</em> and the <em>Book of Psalms</em> and co-editor of <em>The Dead Sea Scrolls After Fifty Years.</em></p>This sweeping and up-to-the-minute introduction to the Dead Sea Scrolls includes many recent developments in Scrolls research, bringing readers current information on new DNA dating techniques, discoveries in linguistics, and archaeological findings. VanderKam (The Dead Sea Scrolls Today) and Flint (The Dead Sea Scrolls Bible) are clearly experts in their field, familiar with all the major (and minor) issues at stake. At times, they become submerged in questions that only other specialists will care about, or render unnecessarily detailed information on particular points (for example, providing a paragraph on each of the major photographers who have worked with the Scrolls, or debating the intricacies of Paleo-Hebrew). Despite these forays into arcana, the authors usually manage to keep their prose free of scholarly jargon. Moreover, the accessible design is first-rate, with helpful sidebars and information boxes to aid the reader. VanderKam and Flint pay special attention to the Scrolls' relationship with biblical and apocryphal literature, offering nuanced discussions of the formation of the biblical canon and the development of various lines of scribal transmission.

Now in its fifth edition, <em>Social Theory: Roots and Branches</em> covers both classical theory (the roots) and contemporary theory (the branches) and shows how they are linked. Part One features work from such well-known classical theorists as Marx, Durkheim, Weber, and Simmel. It also presents selections by theorists outside of the discipline and from writers who are often overlooked in competing collections, including W. E. B. Du Bois, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, and Harriet Martineau. Part Two offers readings that illustrate major contemporary theoretical approaches, ending with a section on cutting-edge directions in theoretical discourse. Now featuring a revised and expanded introductory chapter, this fifth edition offers seventeen new readings, including eight by theorists who are new to this collection.<br></p><p><br><strong>Peter Kivisto </strong>is Richard A.

Linguistics has real-life applications to effective teaching&#x2013;now more than ever. With the increased emphasis on phonemic awareness and phonics in the teaching of reading, teachers need to understand how language works. When teachers are familiar with basic linguistic concepts, they are better prepared to make decisions about how to teach reading, spelling, phonics, and grammar to all students, including English language learners.</p></p><p></p><h2>Securities Regulation, Cases and Analysis (University Casebook Series)</h2><p>Normal wear and tear from moderate use.

These highly collectible editions of the original 24 adventures will delight Tintin fans old and new. Perfect for lovers of graphic novels, mysteries and historical adventures. The world&#39;s most famous travelling reporter heads for America. Gangsters, Cowboys, Indians and the Big Apple await Tintin when he travels across the Atlantic. He soon finds himself in terrible danger - but with Snowy to help him, he faces it head on ...The Adventures of Tintin are among the best books for readers aged 8 and up. Herge (Georges Remi) was born in Brussels in 1907. Over the course of 54 years he completed over 20 titles in The Adventures of Tintin series, which is now considered to be one of the greatest, if not the greatest, comics series of all time.

The stereotypes probably fit how a European would have looked at the New World, from Al Capone's gangsters in Chicago to a Native American tribe in the unfortunately named Redskin City, as Tintin and Snowy escape one peril after another in pursuit of villain Bobby Smiles. It's one of Herge's least complex--and least entertaining--tales, still worth a read but not a good introduction to the series as a whole. <i>--David Horiuchi</i>Herge (Georges Remi) was born in Brussels in 1907.

All too often, books of this nature are either as boring as a repair manual, or obscure and inaccurate. Monture's triumph is that his book is not only the best and most complete book about virtually every aspect of Native American beadwork tools, materials, styles and methods, it is also clear, interesting reading. Written from the point of view of a Native master craftsman who is also a gifted teacher, and accompanied by striking full-color photos, it can serve as either a beginning point or a lifelong reference tool. I am confident that Monture's book will bring him wide praise, not only from beadworkers, but also from any person who delights in knowing more about the meaning and the history of an indigenous artform which is finally attracting the sort of critical attention and informed appreciation it deserves."<br> --Joseph Bruchac, author of Keepers of the Earth<br> * Includes all the basic stitches and designs<br> * Contains a special section on natural tanning methods<br> * Extensive glossary<br> * Full-color photos of authentic Native American beadwork</p><p>Joel Monture (Mohawk), professor of Native American Arts at the Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe, lives in Cochiti Lake, New Mexico.In recent years there has been increasing interest in Native American culture and its history, traditions, and artistic expressions. In their beadwork, Native Americans combine the symbols of objects around them into stylized patterns. This book is designed as an easy-to-follow manual of the how and the why of this craft, including its history and technical development. Chapters discuss the tools and materials generally used, as well as techniques and patterns of various tribes, and provide tips on preparation of the hides and sources for materials. Though the book does presuppose a certain familiarity with tools and access to materials, it is aimed at the novice audience. The personal experience of the creation of a beautiful object is emphasized as a vital part of the Native American craft tradition. Collections serving a community with strong craft interests should find this a useful addition.<br><i>- Paula Frosch, Metropolitan Museum of Art Lib., New York</i><br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Brief Applied Calculus, 6th Edition</h2><p>This text uses intriguing real-world applications to engage readers&#39; interest and show them the practical side of calculus.

But when your whole life gets swept up by a tornado&#x2014;taking you with it&#x2014;you have no choice but to go along, you know?</p><p>Sure, I've read the books. I've seen the movies. I know the song about the rainbow and the happy little blue birds. But I never expected Oz to look like this.

There's still a road of yellow brick&#x2014;but even that's crumbling.</p><p>What happened? Dorothy. They say she found a way to come back to Oz.

I've been recruited by the Revolutionary Order of the Wicked. I've been trained to fight. And I have a mission: Remove the Tin Woodman's heart. Steal the Scarecrow's brain. Take the Lion's courage. And&#x2014;Dorothy must die.</p></p><p><p><b>Danielle Paige, author of <i>Dorothy Must Die</i>, shares her favorite <i>Oz</i> versions. </b></p> <p>It was a thrill for me to write Dorothy Must Die. As a fan of the books, Oz felt like sacred ground. But stepping onto The Yellow Brick Road I saw a million other possibilities stretching out in front of me, some darker and twistier than the Oz we are used to, and I couldn&#x2019;t resist. Here are some other trips down the Yellow Brick Road that I love.</p> <p><strong>The Wizard of Oz (1939, movie) </strong><br> I was smitten from the very first notes of &#x201c;Over the Rainbow.&#x201d; The movie is just perfection. I have seen it so many times it&#x2019;s almost embarrassing. It&#x2019;s epic and timeless. And I still literally stop whatever I&#x2019;m doing and watch when I see it on screen, because it&#x2019;s just that good.</p> <p><strong>Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of The West (1995, book) </strong> <br> Love! I bow to Gregory Maguire! Recasting the Wicked Witch of the West as truly misunderstood, instead of evil, was just a stroke of genius. And the musical is just as satisfying. (I was lucky enough to see it on Broadway with Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth. Just a fabulous production.)</p> <p><strong>Return to Oz (1985, movie) </strong><br> It borrows so many deliciously creepy and quirky details from the Baum Books and makes up some new ones of its own. Seeing Mombi and her closet of interchangeable heads floored me.</p> <p><strong>Tin Man (2007, tv miniseries) </strong><br> The adorable Zooey Deschanel as DG, a descendant of Dorothy, drawn into the SyFy miniseries version of Oz complete with androids and a shape-shifting Toto! One complaint: not a stitch of gingham on Zooey!</p> <p><strong>The Wiz (1978, movie) </strong><br> Just total 70&#x2019;s fun! Oz looks a lot like New York City. It&#x2019;s star studded and unapologetic with a young Michael Jackson as the Scarecrow, Diana Ross as Dorothy, and Sidney Lumet directing. And try to get the songs out of your head. &#x201c;Ease on Down the Road&#x201d; is so catchy. And &#x201c;Home&#x201d; is just one of my all time favorites. (When Kristin Chenoweth sang it on Glee a few years ago, I was so happy!)</p> <p><strong>Oz the Great and Powerful (2013, movie)</strong><br> I love a prequel, and this one's visually stunning as well. The character of the Wizard has always fascinated me. He is a study of reinvention&#x2014;figuring out what makes him tick and how he navigates the world of Oz with a slippery moral compass is inspiring.</p><p>I didn't ask for any of this.<br>I didn't ask to be some kind of hero.</p><p>But when your whole life gets swept up by a tornado&#x2014;taking you with it&#x2014;you have no choice but to go along, you know?</p><p>Sure, I've read the books.

Often regarded as "the poet laureate of Harlem," Hughes was a cental figure in the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s. Known for his insightful, colorful portayals of black life in America from the 1920s to the 1960s, Hughes published more than thirty-five books of poetry, fiction, short stories, children's poetry, musicals, operans, autobiography, scripts, and essays.<br><br>Throughout hs life Hughes was a devoted fan of black music, and he fushed together jazz and blues with traditional verse in his first two books, <i>The Weary Blues </i>and <i>Fine Clothes to the Jew</i>. He was also well known for his creation of the fictional character Jess B. Semple, nicknamed Simple, who satrized racial injustices. In 1929, Hughes earned his B.A. from Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, where he was later presented with an honorary Litt.D. Over the course of his life, Hughes was also awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, a Rosenwald Fellowship, and an American Academy of Arts and Letters Grant.

Between them they are the originators of many of the most significant innovations of 20th-century painting and sculpture, but their relationship has rarely been explored in all of its closeness and complexity. In spite of their initial rivalry, the two masters eventually acknowledged one another as equals, becoming, in their old age, increasingly important to one another both artistically and personally. From the time of their initial encounters in 1906 in Gertrude and Leo Stein's Paris studio until 1917, they individually produced some of the greatest art of the 20th century and maintained an openly competitive relationship brimming with intense innovation. This period saw them create such works as Picasso's majestic "Woman with a Fan" of 1908 and Matisse's great portrait of his wife of 1913. Matisse responds to Synthetic Cubism in his "Piano Lesson" of 1916 and Picasso comes back in turn with a new, more decorative Cubism in "Three Musicians" of 1921. The 20s saw them grow apart, as Matisse moved from Paris to Nice and Picasso became involved with the Surrealists, but the 30s brought them together again, through their sheer fame and devotion to reality-based art. Their story continues until Matisse's death in 1954, when Picasso paid his friend and colleague tribute in his series <i>Women of Algiers</i>, of which he said, "When Matisse died, he left his odalisques to me as a legacy." <i>Matisse Picasso</i> presents the artists' oeuvres in groupings that reveal the affinities but also the extreme contrasts of their artistic visions. Published to accompany the landmark exhibition, a joint effort of The Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Tate Modern, London; the Raunion des musaes nationaux/Musae Picasso and the Musae national d'art moderne/Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; <i>Matisse Picasso</i> is the first major examination of the fascinating relationships between their art, their careers, and their lives. Thirty-four essays, each by a member of the exhibition's curatorial team, focus on a particular moment in the artists' evolving relationship. The authors present in-depth analyses of specific aspects of the unique artistic dialogue between Matisse and Picasso as reflected in selected juxtapositions of each artist's works. These texts are accompanied by an introductory history, commentary on the public perception of important artistic relationships, and an extensive chronology.</p><p>Anne Baldassari is Curator at the Mus�e Picasso, Paris.<br> <p>Elizabeth Cowling is Senior Curator at the Department of Fine Art, University of Edinburgh.<br> </p><p>John Elderfield is Chief Curator at Large at The Museum of Modern Art, New York. <br> </p><p>John Golding is a freelance art historian based in London.<br> </p><p>Isabelle Monod-Fontaine is Deputy Director at the Mus�e national d'art moderne/Centre Pompidou, Paris.<br> </p><p>Kirk Varnedoe, formerly Chief Curator of the Department of Painting and Sculpture at The Museum of Modern Art, New York, is Professor of Historical Studies at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton University.</p>It may have been obvious at the time, but the fact that the two (arguably) greatest painters of the 20th century exchanged ideas fluidly, obliquely and prolifically comes as a shock when put as starkly as in this catalogue and the international blockbuster exhibition it accompanies. The authors, eminent curators all, put together the exhibition (currently hanging at New York's Museum of Modern Art) and contribute a total of 34 short essays contrasting particular works and exploring the currents of the two men's mutual influence, including fauvism and cubism. Matisse's Le bonheur de vivre (1905-6) cemented itself in Picasso's mind from their first meeting, and would "reverberate in Picasso's imagination throughout his life," writes Golding. Varnedoe notes the influence of Matisse's Goldfish and Palette on Picasso's 1915 Harlequin, recalling how a dealer said that Matisse declared that his goldfish had "led to" the other man's harlequin. Unfortunately, an indifferent layout and setting of the text takes some of the charge out of the comparisons-a problem that extends to the flat-seeming cover. And a fairly big chunk of Picasso's oeuvre may look dated to many readers, particularly in comparing his late drawings with Matisse's cut-outs. But the mini-essays are of high quality, and anyone who cares about 20th century art will want to be able to trace the overt and covert steals and competitions chronicled here, as well as the often warm personal relationship.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Art of Jin Shin: The Japanese Practice of Healing with Your Fingertips</h2><p><b>Balance your body, mind, and spirit and heal yourself with your own hands using this clear, step-by-step illustrated guide to the practice of the ancient Japanese healing art of Jin Shin&#x2014;written by a trained expert with nearly three decades of experience. </b><br><br>You might be surprised to learn that the majority of today&#x2019;s most common ailments including anxiety, backaches, colds and flu, digestive issues, immune disorders, migraines, and insomnia, can be alleviated naturally by restoring and harmonizing blocked, stagnant energy.

With these words written in 1833, Sir Charles Bell expressed the central theme of some of the most far-reaching and exciting research being done in science today. For humans, the lifelong apprenticeship with the hand begins at birth. We are guided by our hands, and we are indelibly shaped by the knowledge that comes to us through our use of them.<br><br><i>The Hand</i> delineates the ways in which our hands have shaped our development--cognitive, emotional, linguistic, and psychological--in light of the most recent research being done in anthropology, neuroscience, linguistics, and psychology. How did structural changes in the hand prepare human ancestors for increased use of tools and for our own remarkable ability to design and manufacture them? Is human language rooted in speech, or are its deepest roots to be found in the gestures that made communal hunting and manufacture possible? Is early childhood experience in reaching and grasping the secret of the human brain's unique capacity to redefine intelligence with each new generation in every culture and society?<br><br>Frank Wilson's inquiry incorporates the experiences and insights of jugglers, surgeons, musicians, puppeteers, and car mechanics. His fascinating book illuminates how our hands influence learning and how we, in turn, use our hands to leave our personal stamp on the world.</p><p>The hand is, among other things, a complex symbol, representing both the creative and the prosaic. This blending of the spiritual and the mundane is what makes the hand unique, as it in turn makes us unique among animals. Neurologist Frank R. Wilson has taken on a heroic task: to <i>explain</i> the hand on both of these levels and to show us how we use these marvelous instruments to find and create meaning in our lives. <p> Anthropology, neuroscience, music, and puppetry all figure prominently in <i>The Hand</i>, which effortlessly guides the reader through its million-year biography. Brains and thumbs growing and changing to accommodate each other, discovering tools and language together, kicked us out of the monkey house for good. While there is still controversy over whether we are the brainiest animals on the planet, it is abundantly clear that we are the handiest. </p><p> This manipulative ability is our greatest strength and our most terrible flaw. Without hands we would have no Louvre but also no nerve gas. But, Wilson says, our situation is more complex. Our access to far greater means to achieve our ends gives us a greater hunger for meaning. We long to use our hands to satisfy our needs--whether spiritual or down-to-earth. This creation of meaning from nothing may be our greatest achievement. In the end, <i>The Hand</i> is brightly optimistic, showing that our reach truly does exceed our grasp. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>"The remarkable human hand has clearly played a fundamental role in our evolution, but it is rarely accorded the prominence it deserves in discussion of the human fossil record. In this lively and highly personal account Frank Wilson engagingly redresses the balance, restoring the hand and the structures that move it to the very center of the story, and relating them ingeniously to the cognitive uniqueness that we normally consider the hallmarks of humanity. A book for everyone curious about how we became what we are."<br>--Ian Tattersall, author of Becoming Human<br><br> "This is a book to savor as one does a gourmet meal, not as one wolfs an oyster. It is about more than hand and brain and language and culture; it is about people, fascinating, remarkable, outstanding people, all of them individuals who have found their role in life and love it and are successful at it, and owe it all to their use of their hands and brains and bodies. Best of all, perhaps, is that Wilson sees this as able to change the world-simply by realizing that underlying language, intellect, and intelligence is the understanding that comes from hands-on experience. It is my candidate for best book of the decade."<br>--William Stokoe, author of Simultaneous Communication, Asl, and Other Classroom Communication Modes</p><h2>Games for Writing: Playful Ways to Help Your Child Learn to Write</h2><p><p>There is no skill more important for a child to master more than writing - and none more difficult or fraught with anxiety.

He grew up in Caerleon, Monmouthshire, and attended boarding school at Hereford Cathedral School. He moved to London in 1881 and worked as a journalist, children's tutor, and publisher's clerk, finding time to write at night. By 1894, Machen had his first major success. <i>The Great God Pan</i> was published by John Lane, and despite widespread criticism for its sexual and horrific content, it sold well and went into a second edition. In the 1920s Machen's work became immensely popular in the United States, but Machen experienced increasing poverty; he was saved in 1931 by receiving a Civil List pension from the British government. Arthur Machen died on March 30, 1947. <br><br><b> S. T. Joshi</b> (b. 1958) is the author of such critical studies as <i>The Modern Weird Tale</i> (2001). His exhaustive biography, <i>H. P.

He is an avid fan of weird fiction and fantasy writing and the genres heavily inspire his movies."The pleasure of rediscovering these stories or experiencing them for the first time is sure to be amplified by the insightful foreword by filmmaker Guillermo del Toro (<i>Pan's Labyrinth</i>) and the excellent introduction by S. T. Joshi." &#x2014; <b>Craig Smith</b><br><br><p>"As a selection of 'weird' short stories, <i>The White People</i> is a fine example of the precursor to what has become a popular subgenre of fantasy fiction, as well as a window on to the spiritual concerns of the Welsh author Arthur Machen (1863-1947): the veil separating the phenomenal world and the supernal realm is thin.

Its author, Zhang Zhong Jing, has been named the "Chinese Hippocrates" to highlight the depth and breadth of his contribution to traditional Chinese drug therapy. <p>This edition features the Chinese text, Pinyin transliteration, and an English translation of the entire Song Dynasty text, the content and textual order most used in Asia. Just as in Chinese language editions, it is fully supplemented with notes and commentaries. The notes describe the clinical symptoms Zhang Zhong Jing associated with the Chinese terms. For example, modern interpretations of a "moderate" pulse often refer to the speed of its beats. The same term, when used in the <i>Shang Han Lun,</i> refers to a pulse that is loose, soft, and harmonious. Such notes provide practitioners with the clinical observations necessary to properly apply the information. </p><p>The commentaries further enhance the text's clinical utility by explaining the theoretical and practical foundations behind the lines of text. Because entire bodies of theory and practice can be associated with the terms and expressions used in cannonical works like the <i>Shang Han Lun</i>, commentaries have become a standard means of knowledge acquisition for Asian students. The commentaries in this edition serve exactly the same purpose, greatly enhancing its utility. The introductory matter explains the background of the text, the conceptual structure of its contents, and the problems of exegesis.

The scope of the changes for the tenth edition, however, is much more all-encompassing than that of past revisions. Thoughtful suggestions from many readers inspired a major reorganization of the material, such that the new book presents the central concepts of animal behavior in a different sequence from prior editions:<br><br><strong>The Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection. </strong>Instead of introducing the concept of proximate and ultimate causation and then focusing heavily on the proximate mechanisms of behavior in the early chapters, this edition focuses first on the evolutionary basis of behavior. Chapter 1 presents the concept of a Darwinian puzzle, a trait that exists even though it seems to reduce the reproductive success of individuals, in which case it should have been eliminated by natural selection. The emphasis on Darwinian puzzles continues, with an in-depth discussion of the evolution of altruism in Chapter 2 (versus Chapter 14) and subsequent exploration of the adaptive value of a broad range of traits from anti-predator activities to reproductive and parental behaviors.<br><br><strong>The Distinction between Proximate and Ultimate Causation in Biology. </strong>Once the major findings of behavioral ecology have been examined, the book turns its attention to the proximate mechanisms underlying animal behavior. Here, too, the emphasis remains on the evolutionary puzzles provided by particular developmental and neurophysiological mechanisms. This approach provides continuity with earlier chapters while helping readers see the connections between adaptive behaviors and the adaptive internal systems that make those behaviors possible.<br><br><strong>The Procedures That Scientists Use to Test Their Tentative Explanations for Such Things as Darwinian Puzzles. </strong>Throughout, the text shows how researchers use scientific logic to study the underlying mechanisms and the evolutionary bases of behavior. The emphasis is on how evolutionary theory unifies the various subdisciplines within animal behavior. These points are highlighted again in the final chapter on human behavior, with its treatment of the proximate and ultimate causes of language and the evolution of mate choice in our species.<br><br>Enduring features of prior editions remain evident in this new book: the clear, engaging writing style; text beautifully illustrated with many new photographs; references to a large number of new scientific articles; and a substantial number of new and old discussion questions embedded in the text.<br><br><strong>For Instructors</strong><br><br>Available to qualified adopters of <em>Animal Behavior</em>, the Tenth Edition <strong>Instructor's Resource Library</strong> contains a variety of teaching and laboratory resources. The IRL includes the following:<br><br><strong>Textbook Figures &amp; Tables</strong> All of the textbook's figures (art and photographs) and tables are provided in both JPEG (high- and low-resolution) and PowerPoint formats. All of the images have been formatted and optimized for excellent projection quality.<br><br><strong>Animal Behavior Video Collection</strong> This collection of video segments brings to life many of the specific behaviors discussed in the textbook. Compiled from the collection of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology's Macaulay Library and from many individual researchers, these clips are great for use in class. The segments are short and easy to incorporate into lectures. All segments are provided as QuickTime movies and in ready-to-use PowerPoint presentations.<br><br><strong></strong><strong><em>Teaching Animal Behavior</em></strong><strong>: An Instructor's Manual to Accompany </strong><strong><em>Animal Behavior</em></strong><strong>, Tenth Edition</strong><br><em>Teaching Animal Behavior</em> offers instructors several resources to facilitate the preparation of lectures, quizzes, and exams. Contents include:<br><br>* Answers to the discussion questions presented in the textbook<br>* Sample quiz questions and answers<br>* Sample exam questions and answers<br>* Descriptions to accompany the collection of animal behavior videos<br>* A listing of films on animal behavior for use in the classroom<br> <br><strong>Learning the Skills of Research: Animal Behavior Exercises in the Laboratory and Field</strong><br>Edited by Elizabeth M. Jakob and Margaret Hodge<br><br>Students learn best about the process of science by carrying out projects from start to finish. Animal behavior laboratory classes are particularly well-suited for independent student research, as high-quality projects can be conducted with simple materials and in a variety of environments. The exercises in this electronic lab manual are geared to helping students learn about all stages of the scientific process: hypothesis development, observing and quantifying animal behavior, statistical analysis, and data presentation. Additional exercises allow the students to practice these skills, with topics ranging from habitat selection in isopods to human navigation. Both student and instructor documentation is provided. Data sheets and other supplementary material are offered in editable formats that instructors can modify as desired.</p><p><br><strong>John Alcock </strong>is Regents' Professor Emeritus of Biology at Arizona State University. He received his Ph.D. from Harvard University under the direction of Ernst Mayr. His research deals with the behavioral ecology of insect mating systems, with projects that have taken him from Arizona to Costa Rica and Australia. He wrote The Triumph of <em>Sociobiology</em> (2001) and coauthored <em>The Evolution of Insect Mating Systems </em>(1983) with Randy Thornhill. Alcock has also written seven other books on animal behavior and natural history for general audiences. One of these, <em>In a Desert Garden</em>, received the Burroughs' Award for natural history writing in 1998. Dr. Alcock also received the Dean's Quality Teaching Award the first year it was given at Arizona State University.<br><br>"The tenth edition talks about behavioral ecology early and often. I commend this conceptual shift and the overall bold revision of a classic textbook. It would have been adequate to simply sprinkle in new studies within the existing framework, so the changes seem to reflect a heartfelt desire of Alcock to make an excellent volume even better. This is clearly a labor of love and has a strong personal flavor for a textbook. As in previous editions, the narrative is powered by Alcock's infectious desire to present science, evolution, and behavior clearly and memorably. I recommend this volume to all students of animal behavior. It is a great place to first discover the field, or to rediscover the big picture after years of work within the field." --Peter A. Bednekoff, <em>The Quarterly Review of Biology</em><p></p><br>"I absolutely love this book. I have become a great fan of John Alcock. His discussions within the chapter are extremely gripping and I love his approach connecting all aspects of the genetics, environment, and evolution to the animal's behavior. Kudos!" --Madeline Mignone, <em>Dominican College</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Introductory Plant Biology</h2><p>This introductory text assumes little prior scientific knowledge on the part of the student.

At every turn, Hern�ndez names names &#x2013; not just the narcos, but also the politicians, functionaries, judges and entrepreneurs who have collaborated with them. In doing so, she reveals the mind-boggling depth of corruption in Mexico&#x2019;s government and business elite. <br><br>Hern�ndez became a journalist after her father was kidnapped and killed and the police refused to investigate without a bribe.

It talks about the kinds of things I wish that someone had encouraged me to think about when I was going to college&#x2014;such as what the point of college might be in the first place.<br> <br>I was like so many kids today (and so many kids back then). I went off to college like a sleepwalker, like a zombie. College was a blank. College was the &#x201c;next thing.&#x201d; You went to college, you studied something, and afterward you went on to the next next thing, most probably some kind of graduate school. Up ahead were vaguely understood objectives: status, wealth, getting to the top&#x2014;in a word, &#x201c;success.&#x201d; As for where you went to school, that was all about bragging rights, so of course you chose the most prestigious place that let you in. What it meant to actually get an education, and why you might want one&#x2014;how it could help you acquire a self, or develop an independent mind, or find your way in the world&#x2014;all this was off the table. Like kids today, I was processed through a system everyone around me simply took for granted.<br> <br>I started college in 1981. The system, then, was in its early days, but it was already, unmistakably, a system, a set of tightly interlocking parts. When I speak in this book of elite education, I mean prestigious institutions like Harvard or Stanford or Williams as well as the larger universe of second-tier selective schools, but I also mean everything that leads up to and away from them: the private and affluent public high schools; the ever-growing industry of tutors and consultants, test-prep courses and enrichment programs; the admissions process itself, squatting like a dragon at the entrance to adulthood; the brand-name graduate schools and employment opportunities that come after the BA; and the parents and communities, largely upper middle class, who push their children into the maw of this machine. In short, our entire system of elite education.<br> <br>What that system does to kids and how they can escape from it, what it does to our society and how we can dismantle it&#x2014;those are the subjects of this book. I was teaching a class at Yale on the literature of friendship. One day we got around to talking about the importance of being alone. The ability to engage in introspection, I suggested, is the essential precondition for living the life of the mind, and the essential precondition for introspection is solitude. My students took this in for a second&#x2014;introspection, solitude, the life of the mind, things they probably had not been asked to think about before&#x2014;then one of them said, with a dawning sense of self-awareness, &#x201c;So are you saying that we&#x2019;re all just, like, really excellent sheep?&#x201d;<br> <br>All? Surely not. But after twenty-four years in the Ivy League&#x2014;college at Columbia; a PhD at the same institution, including five years as a graduate instructor; and ten years, altogether, on the faculty at Yale&#x2014;that was more or less how I had come to feel about it. The system manufactures students who are smart and talented and driven, yes, but also anxious, timid, and lost, with little intellectual curiosity and a stunted sense of purpose: trapped in a bubble of privilege, heading meekly in the same direction, great at what they&#x2019;re doing but with no idea why they&#x2019;re doing it. In 2008, on my way out the door, I published an essay that sketched out a few of these criticisms. Titled &#x201c;The Disadvantages of an Elite Education,&#x201d; the article appeared in the American Scholar, a small literary quarterly. At best, I thought, it might get a few thousand readers.<br> <br>Instead, it started to go viral almost from the moment it came out. Within a few weeks, the piece had been viewed a hundred thousand times (with many times that number in the months and years to come). Apparently I&#x2019;d touched a nerve. These were not just the grumblings of an ex-professor. As it turned out from the many emails I began to get, the vast majority from current students and recent graduates, I had evoked a widespread discontent among today&#x2019;s young high achievers&#x2014;a sense that the system was cheating them out of a meaningful education, instilling them with values they rejected but couldn&#x2019;t somehow get beyond, and failing to equip them to construct their futures.<br> <br>Since then I have spoken with students on campuses across the country, corresponded with many others, answered these young people&#x2019;s questions and asked my own, and heard and read their stories. It has been an education in itself, and this book is a reflection of that ongoing dialogue. Where possible, I&#x2019;ve used their words to help me talk about the issues we&#x2019;ve discussed, but every page has been informed by my sense of what these kinds of students need and want to think about. A lot of books get published about higher education, but none, as far as I can tell, are speaking to students themselves&#x2014;still less, listening to them.<br> <br>I begin the book by discussing the system itself&#x2014;one that, to put it in a nutshell, forces you to choose between learning and success. Education is the way that a society articulates its values: the way that it transmits its values. While I&#x2019;m often critical of the sort of kids who populate selective schools, my real critique is aimed at the adults who&#x2019;ve made them who they are&#x2014;that is to say, at the rest of us. Part 2 begins to explain what students can do, as individuals, to rescue themselves from the system: what college should be for, how to find a different kind of path in life, what it means to be a genuine leader. Part 3 extends the argument, talking in detail about the purpose of a liberal arts education, the value of the humanities, and the need for dedicated teachers and small classrooms. My aim is not to tell young people where to go to school so much as why.<br> <br>Part 4 returns to the larger social question. The system is charged with producing our leadership class, the so-called meritocracy&#x2014;the people who run our institutions, governments, and corporations. So how has that been going? Not, it&#x2019;s clear by now, too well. What we&#x2019;re doing to our kids we&#x2019;re ultimately doing to ourselves. The time has long since passed, I argue, to rethink, reform, and reverse the entire project of elite education.<br> <br>A word on what I mean when I speak of the elite. I don&#x2019;t intend the term as it is often now deployed, as a slur against liberals, intellectuals, or anyone who disagrees with Bill O&#x2019;Reilly, but simply as a name for those who occupy the upper echelons of our society: conservatives as well as liberals, businesspeople as well as professionals, the upper and the upper middle classes both&#x2014;the managers, the winners, the whole cohort of people who went to selective colleges and are running society for their own exclusive benefit. This book is also, implicitly, a portrait of that class, whose time to leave the stage of history has now so evidently come.</p><h2>The Story of the World: History for the Classical Child, Volume 2: The Middle Ages</h2><p>This read-aloud series is designed for parents to share with elementary-school children.

But Julian Barbour disagrees: if nothing happened, if nothing changed, time would stop. For time is nothing but change. It is change that we perceive occurring all around us, not time. In fact, time doesn't exist. <br> In this highly provocative volume, Barbour presents the basic evidence for the nonexistence of time, explaining what a timeless universe is like and showing how the world will nonetheless be experienced as intensely temporal. It is a book that strikes at the heart of modern physics, that casts doubt on Einstein's greatest contribution, the space-time continuum, but that also points to the solution of one of the great paradoxes of modern science: the chasm between classical and quantum physics. Indeed, Barbour argues that the unification of Einstein's general relativity and quantum mechanics may well spell the end of time--time will cease to have a role in the foundations of physics.<br> Barbour writes with remarkable clarity, as he ranges from ancient philosophers such as Heraclitus and Parmenides, to such giants of science as Galileo, Newton, and Einstein, to the work of contemporary physicists such as John Wheeler, Roger Penrose, and Steven Hawking. Along the way, the author treats us to an enticing look at some of the mysteries of the universe and presents intriguing ideas about multiple worlds, time travel, immortality, and, above all, the illusion of motion.<br> Turning our understanding of reality inside-out, <em>The End of Time</em> is a vibrantly written and revolutionary book.<br></p><p><br><strong>Julian Barbour</strong>, a theoretical physicist, has worked on foundational issues in physics for 35 years. Heis the author of the widely praised <em>Absolute or Relative Motion?: Volume I</em>, and is working on the second volume.<br>Where does the time go? Independent physicist Barbour presents an unusual alternate to the standard way of viewing the four-dimensional universe (three spatial dimensions and time), beginning with how our perception of time is formed. Time, he says, does not exist apart from events: the motions of the sun and the stars, the mechanical movement of a clock. Rather than truly feeling the passing of time, we merely note changes in our surroundings, described by the author as a series of "Nows," like frames of a motion picture. Not only do Nows exist for the events that actually occur, but a large number of Nows represent alternate possibilities, inhabiting a land called Platonia. Which Nows become our perceived reality? The rule of thumb Barbour gives is, "only the probable is experienced." In the "macro" world, the author addresses determinism, Newtonian mechanics and the second law of thermodynamics as they relate to his theory of Nows. In the quantum mechanical realm, he ties his theory of time to the Schrodinger Equation in its various forms. Throughout, the author accompanies his theories not with complex equations but rather with elegant (if sometimes convoluted) diagrams. If these theories sound intriguing, readers already familiar with the Wheeler-DeWitt and Schrodinger equations, eigenstates and wave functions may appreciate this unique perspective. Ultimately, however, Barbour's attempts to "simplify" physics, in particular quantum mechanics, will confuse as many readers as they enlighten. 20 illustrations.

It's partly about learning how to draw a set of straight lines that meet at a point, but it's not filled with lots of dull, dry theory (although it does explain how it all works). Instead, it gives you tons of fun, practical exercises, and encourages you to play with them, so that learning how to draw in perspective is effortless and easy. Put your observational skills to the test with:<ul><li>Image Quizzes: take a pen and draw in all the vanishing points onto the book itself</li><li>Perspective Chambers: draw objects onto an existing scene, keeping it all in the right perspective--sort of like 3D doodling</li><li>Unique exercises with more than 100 vanishing points to figure out</li></ul><br>By the time you've completed this book, you will have a keen understanding of how perspective really works. Plus, you'll learn how to look at the world around you, see what's really there, and spot where those invisible straight lines may be located. It will become like a sixth sense to you--one that will add depth and meaning to all of your artistic pursuits.</p><p>Matthew Brehm is an Associate Professor of Architecture at the University of Idaho, where his teaching responsibilities include design studios, graphics courses, and an annual two-month study abroad program in Rome, Italy.

He is the author of <i>Sketching on Location.</i><br><b>From the reviews:</b><br>"This detailed yet comprehensive drawing guide accurately depicts the myriad applications of perspective through simple explanations and the extensive use of relevant graphics. It clarifies how perspective can be utilized as the underlying structure to an image and yield extraordinary results for both interior and exterior scenes, regardless of medium, subject matter or style. Techniques for observation and sketching to scale are a nice touch, as are specifics about delineating various geometric forms. Though anyone could improve their visual acuity with this user-friendly book, art students will find it indispensable."<br>&#x2014;<i>San Francisco Book Review, www.sanfranciscobookreview.com</i><br></p><h2>The New Book of Goddesses &amp; Heroines</h2><p>They come out in your dreams, your creativity, and your passion. They represent you in all your glory and complexity, and you represent them. They are the goddesses and heroines that form your true history. Now let these mythic stories nourish your soul as they speak to you on a level as deep and mysterious as the source of life itself. <br> <br>Goddesses and heroines exist in virtually every culture and every time. Now you can discover their secrets in <i>The New Book of Goddesses &amp; Heroines</i> (an expanded edition of <i>The Book of Goddess and Heroines)</i> by Patricia Monaghan. <br> <br>The third edition of this classic reference offers a complete collection of goddess myths from around the globe and includes over fifty photographs from the world-famous Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. And now there is a section on "Cultures of the Goddess", which provides information on the major religious systems detailed in the myths. <br> <br>Discover more than 1,500 goddesses from Australia, Africa, North and South America, Asia, Europe-and experience her as she truly is. This new edition also adds hundreds of new entries to the original text-information found only in rare or limited editions and obscure sources. <br> <br>Never before has such a vast panorama of female divinity been recorded in one source-this fascinating book is a testament to the great diversity of her power. <br> <br>Winner of the 1998 Coalition of Visionary Resources (COVR) Award for best Non-fiction book <br></p><p><p>One of the leaders of the contemporary earth spirituality movement, Patricia Monaghan (1946 - 2012) had spent more than 20 years researching and writing about alternative visions of the earth. &nbsp;Raised in Alaska, where much of her family still lives, she considered herself blessed to have learned the ecology of the taiga, the subarctic forest, in her youth. &nbsp;She was a writer and reporter on science and energy-related issues before turning her attention to the impact of mythic structures on our everyday lives. <br> <br>The worldwide vision of the earth as feminine--as a goddess, called Gaia by the Greeks--led her to recognize the connection between ecological damage and the oppression of the feminine in Western society. &nbsp;Much of her work since that time had explored the question of the role of feminine power in our world, in an inclusive and multicultural way. &nbsp; <br> <br>An avid traveler, Patricia had researched earth spirituality and goddess worship on three continents, and traveled widely in Europe, especially in Ireland. &nbsp;She held dual US/Irish citizenship and edited two anthologies of contemporary Irish-American writing. <br> <br>Patricia was member of the resident faculty at DePaul University's School for New Learning in Chicago, where she taught science and literature.&nbsp; She passed from this world in November 2012 and is survived by her husband, Dr Michael McDermott.<br> </p>In the introduction to this third edition of her useful encyclopedia, Monaghan (Magical Gardens: Myth, Mulch &amp; Marigolds, Llewellyn. 1997) offers a chronicle of changes in technology and research methodology that librarians will appreciate. The encyclopedia opens with an excellent essay entitled "Cultures of the Goddess" that discusses the myths, legends, and goddess worship of every civilization. Clear, well written, and informative, the entries that follow are longer than dictionary entries and shorter than encyclopedia entries. In addition, there are more than 50 photographs of statues, vases, and other artifacts. The book concludes with an excellent index of goddesses arranged by attributions (e.g., love, death, weather, and insects), an index that provides variant names, and a listing of feast days. The result is an exceptionally fine reference work that is both readable and well arranged. Highly recommended for public, school, and college libraries.?Gail Wood, SUNY Coll. of Technology Lib., Alfred<br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Bird Brain: An Exploration of Avian Intelligence</h2><p><p><b>Why birds are smarter than we think</b></p><p>Birds have not been known for their high IQs, which is why a person of questionable intelligence is sometimes called a "birdbrain." Yet in the past two decades, the study of avian intelligence has witnessed dramatic advances. From a time when birds were seen as simple instinct machines responding only to stimuli in their external worlds, we now know that some birds have complex internal worlds as well. This beautifully illustrated book provides an engaging exploration of the avian mind, revealing how science is exploding one of the most widespread myths about our feathered friends&#x2015;and changing the way we think about intelligence in other animals as well.</p><p><i>Bird Brain</i> looks at the structures and functions of the avian brain, and describes the extraordinary behaviors that different types of avian intelligence give rise to.

This lively and accessible book shows how birds have sophisticated brains with abilities previously thought to be uniquely human, such as mental time travel, self-recognition, empathy, problem solving, imagination, and insight.</p><p>Written by a leading expert and featuring a foreword by Frans de Waal, renowned for his work on animal intelligence, <i>Bird Brain</i> shines critical new light on the mental lives of birds.</p></p><p><p>"<i>Bird Brain</i> is a winner.

At the end of 1937, J R R Tolkien reluctantly set aside his work on the myths and heroic legends of Valinor and Middle-earth and began The Lord of the Rings. This fifth volume of The History of Middle-earth completes the examination of his writing up to that time. Later forms of The Annals of Valinor and The Annals of Beleriand had been composed, The Silmarillion was nearing completion in a greatly amplified form, and a new Map had been made. The legend of the Downfall of Numenor had entered the work, including those central ideas: the World Made Round and the Straight Path into the vanished West. Closely associated with this was the abandoned &#39;time-travel&#39; story The Lost Road, linking the world of Numenor and Middle-earth with the legends of many other times and peoples. Also included in this volume is the The Lhammas, as essay on the complex languages and dialects of Middle-earth, and an &#39;etymological dictionary&#39; containing an extensive account of Elvish vocabularies.</p><p>The History of Middle-earth 5<br>Edited by Christopher Tolkien<br>INKLINGS OF GREATNESS . . . <br>J.R.R.

Taking his inspiration from a family gathering held every year on the Feast of the Epiphany, Joyce pens a story about a married couple attending a Christmas-season party at the house of the husband&#x2019;s two elderly aunts. A shocking confession made by the husband&#x2019;s wife toward the end of the story showcases the power of Joyce&#x2019;s greatest innovation: the epiphany, that moment when everything, for character and reader alike, is suddenly clear.</p><p>James Augustine Aloysius Joyce (1882-1941) was an Irish writer and poet, widely considered to be one of the most influential writers of the 20th century. Along with Marcel Proust, Virginia Woolf, and William Faulkner, Joyce is a key figure in the development of the modernist novel. He is best known for his landmark novel Ulysses (1922). Other major works are the short-story collection Dubliners (1914), and the novels A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1916) and Finnegans Wake (1939). Although most of his adult life was spent outside the country, Joyce&#39;s Irish experiences are essential to his writings and provide all of the settings for his fiction and much of their subject matter. In particular, his rocky early relationship with the Irish Catholic Church is reflected by a similar conflict in his character Stephen Dedalus, who appears in two of his novels. His fictional universe is firmly rooted in Dublin and reflects his family life and the events and friends (and enemies) from his school and college days; Ulysses is set with precision in the real streets and alleyways of the city. As the result of the combination of this attention to one place and his voluntary exile in continental Europe, most notably in Paris, Joyce paradoxically became both one of the most cosmopolitan yet most regionally focused of all the English language writers of his time.<b>James Joyce</b> was born in Dublin in 1882, the oldest of ten children in a Catholic family. He attended Jesuit schools and, in 1904, moved first to Trieste, then Paris, with Nora Barnacle; they married in 1931. After publishing his first novel, <i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i>, in 1916, Joyce developed glaucoma, and his eyesight steadily diminished for the rest of his life. His seminal novel <i>Ulysses</i> was published by his friend Sylvia Beach out of her Paris bookstore, only to be banned in the US and elsewhere due to charges of indecency. Fleeing the Nazi invasion of France, Joyce died in Zurich in 1941.</p><h2>Earth Lab: Exploring the Earth Sciences</h2><p>Utilizing graphs and simple calculations, this clearly written lab manual complements the study of earth science or physical geology.

In three days of furious writing, he produced a story about his dream existence. His wife found it too gruesome, so he promptly burned the manuscript. In another three days, he wrote it again. <i>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i> was published as a "shilling shocker" in 1886, and became an instant classic. In the first six months, 40,000 copies were sold. Queen Victoria read it. Sermons and editorials were written about it. When Stevenson and his family visited America a year later, they were mobbed by reporters at the dock in New York City. Compulsively readable from its opening pages, <i>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i> is still one of the best tales ever written about the divided self. <p> This University of Nebraska Press edition is a small, exquisitely produced paperback. The book design, based on the original first edition of 1886, includes wide margins, decorative capitals on the title page and first page of each chapter, and a clean, readable font that is 19th-century in style. Joyce Carol Oates contributes a foreword in which she calls Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde a "mythopoetic figure" like Frankenstein, Dracula, and Alice in Wonderland, and compares Stevenson's creation to doubled selves in the works of Plato, Poe, Wilde, and Dickens. </p><p> This edition also features 12 full-page wood engravings by renowned illustrator Barry Moser. Moser is a skillful reader and interpreter as well as artist, and his afterword to the book, in which he explains the process by which he chose a self-portrait motif for the suite of engravings, is fascinating. For the image of Edward Hyde, he writes, "I went so far as to have my dentist fit me out with a carefully sculpted prosthetic of evil-looking teeth. But in the final moments I had to abandon the idea as being inappropriate. It was more important to stay in keeping with the text and, like Stevenson, not show Hyde's face."

He was in his late forties when he committed himself to writing an ode a week, and in the end he produced a total of 225, which are dispersed throughout his varied oeuvre. This bilingual volume, edited by Ilan Stavans, a distinguished translator and scholar of Latin American literature, gathers all Neruda&#x2019;s odes for the first time in any language. Rendered into English by an assortment of accomplished translators, including Philip Levine, Paul Muldoon, Mark Strand, and Margaret Sayers Peden, collectively they read like the personal diary of a man in search of meaning who sings to life itself, to our connections to one another, and to the place we have in nature and the cosmos. <i>All the Odes</i> is also a lasting statement on the role of poetry as a lightning rod during tumultuous times.</p></p><p><p><b>Pablo Neruda</b> (1904&#x2013;73) was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1971. His books include <i>Residence on</i> <i>Earth</i>, <i>Canto General</i>, <i>Extravagaria</i>, and <i>Isla Negra</i>. <br><b></b><br><b>Ilan Stavans </b>is the Lewis-Sebring Professor in Latin American and Latino Culture at Amherst College.</p>The Chilean Nobel laureate, who died in 1973, combined stratospheric powers of invention with a fecundity that bordered on the prolix; among his many creations were 225 odes, almost all in very short lines, connecting accessible, democratic vocabulary to exalted emotion. Most of the odes date from the 1950s; some odes on household objects (to a lemon, to a potato) remain much imitated in English. Stavans says he is the first to gather all the odes, including very late, very early, and more formal outliers. Stavans and a few lesser-known translators account for a large majority of translations here, though W. S. Merwin and Stephen Mitchell also appear. Along with a fishing boat, an elephant, vegetables, French fries, New Year&#39;s Day, and other this-worldly phenomena, Neruda&#39;s odes show both his communist and romantic sides, praising love itself, clarity, broken things, and V. I. Lenin. This enormous book provides an education of sorts into Neruda&#39;s contexts as well as his effusive mind. Daunting to read straight through, sometimes banal, the volume nonetheless has profuse delights: Neruda lauds seagulls as you are:/ your insatiable voraciousness,/ your screech in the rain, while Ode to Laziness begins Yesterday I felt this ode/ would not get off the floor.

Here are his teachings concerning "natural law," secular versus religious authority, the goals of moral conduct, diseases of the soul, the application of logic to ethical matters, and the messianic era. Throughout, the great sage is concerned to reconcile the apparent divergence between biblical teachings and Greek philosophy.</p><p>Text: English, Arabic, Hebrew (translation)</p><h2>The Professional Pastry Chef</h2><p>Shares recipes for pastries, tarts, breads, cakes, meringues, cookies, custards, mousses, souffles, frozen desserts, sauces, and decorations, and discusses ingredients and special equipment</p><p>The Professional Pastry Chef Third Edition Bo Friberg The Culinary Institute of America at Greystone A longtime favorite of pastry lovers and serious chefs worldwide, this comprehensive specialty cookbook has grown to nearly 1,200 pages and is presented in a larger, simplified format that is much easier to use.

I mean, really. I was a healthy, happy, vegan-eating, marathon-running thirty-nine-year-old with no family history of breast cancer.<br> <br>As a bookworm, I first thought, &#x201c;I need the perfect book to get me through this.&#x201d; What I needed was a lifeline, a guide and point of reference, a source of encouragement that was simultaneously honest and informative, practical and supportive, beautiful and serious, realistic and uplifting. No such book existed. So, I decided to write the book that I desperately sought, but could not find, after my breast cancer diagnosis. This book is for you.<br> <br>The story is fundamentally my journey of self-discovery through illness, finding Silver Linings in life, and celebrating grace and positive thinking from the time of my breast cancer diagnosis through treatment, recovery, and ultimately the celebration of life after breast cancer.<br> <br>Why Silver Linings? you ask. Well, I&#x2019;ve always been a &#x201c;half-full&#x201d; kind of girl. It&#x2019;s easy to be half-full when life is good, when wondering what to make for dinner is the most pressing issue of the day. However, my half-fullness was first challenged in my professional life as a hospice nurse, caring for both dying adults and dying children, and then in my personal life when I became a cancer patient.<br> <br>In my clinical practice as a hospice nurse, I vividly remember caring for a woman with breast cancer. She was in her late forties, with two young daughters. I remember playing on the floor of the living room of the hospital unit with the girls, feeling utterly helpless because I didn&#x2019;t know what to say or do with them. After all, I was in my late twenties. I wasn&#x2019;t yet a mother. And I hadn&#x2019;t been trained in talking with children.<br> <br>Yet, somehow this woman&#x2014;this dying woman&#x2014;put the staff at ease by talking about all of the positive things in her life, the things that brought her joy, such as watching her children play, the smell of food cooking (even if she couldn&#x2019;t eat it), having a day without pain. She taught the staff&#x2014;and, more important, her daughters&#x2014;about resilience and finding Silver Linings and seeing the light&#x2014;even a sliver&#x2014;in the darkest circumstances.<br> <br>Fast-forward to October 2010. When I heard the words &#x201c;You have breast cancer,&#x201d; my first thought&#x2014;literally my first thought&#x2014;was: &#x201c;This could be so much worse. My form of cancer is treatable.&#x201d;<br> <br>As a nurse and social worker, I now found myself in the hospital bed. As a patient, I gained a whole new and unexpected conscious sensitivity to the physical and emotional aspects of being a patient, from becoming a human pincushion to contending with the common feelings of sadness, fear, and anxiety.<br> <br>In fact, between my diagnosis and surgery, I felt lost and overwhelmed. I went through a period of internal struggle during which part of me was feeling like the lead character in Life of Pi: alone at sea with no clue where I was and a ginormous tiger in my boat.<br> <br><br> <br>Before I allowed myself to be eaten by this tiger I gave myself a Moonstruck &#x201c;snap out of it&#x201d; moment and reminded myself of the woman for whom I cared in hospice. I remembered feeling so inspired by her resilience&#x2014;her ability to cope with stress and adversity&#x2014;in the face of overwhelming odds, that from the moment of my diagnosis, I consciously chose to look for the positive, the Silver Linings.<br> <br>Now here&#x2019;s the thing about Silver Linings: unfortunately (!) they don&#x2019;t take away the pain, nausea, mouth sores, or constipation that can come with a cancer diagnosis and treatment, but they do provide balance, perspective, and hope.<br> <br>When you have cancer, Silver Linings come in small and big packages. From watching a hummingbird outside my bedroom window (because I was too sick to stand), to enduring a side effect&#x2013;filled treatment, to being cancer free (after enduring the longest and most painful year of my life), I know that Silver Linings are always present. All one has to do is look for them.<br> <br>I realized that I had two choices about how I was going to handle my diagnosis: from a place of fear or from a place of optimism. I chose&#x2014;and it was indeed a very active choice for me&#x2014;optimism in the form of finding Silver Linings. There were many days when finding Silver Linings was a really, really hard choice. On one or two occasions I even doubted whether it was possible to find them. However, I did, because Silver Linings are always there.<br> <br>This book evolved from my blog, The Silver Pen. I started writing the blog shortly after my diagnosis to keep my family and friends apprised of what was going on with me during my treatment. Prior to my diagnosis, as a nurse and a social worker, I had written a few academic papers and a couple of book chapters, but I had never written about myself. Gulp.<br> <br>The truth is that I started writing so that I wouldn&#x2019;t have to talk with people and field the same well-meaning and lovingly intended but&#x2014;for a patient&#x2014;unbearable question of &#x201c;How are you?&#x201d; over and over again. How many times could I say, &#x201c;I feel horrendous&#x201d;?<br> <br>I was thinking of my family as well. I didn&#x2019;t want them to be burdened with having to repeat stories over and over again. So if my husband wanted to get away from Cancerville (the name of our home for a year) and go out for the evening, when people asked how I was, he could say, &#x201c;Read The Silver Pen. Hollye writes everyday.&#x201d;<br> <br>So, The Silver Pen became my personal experience with cancer, written through the lens of my professional experience. An unexpected Silver Lining was that in a fairly short period of time, the blog went viral. What started as a way to communicate with family and friends became a source of information and&#x2014;so I&#x2019;m told&#x2014;inspiration that gives a descriptive voice to the breast cancer experience.<br> <br>This book, with its balance of substance, beauty, humor, and hope, artfully provides the opportunity to see the breast cancer experience from both sides of the bed, from the perspective of an experienced nurse and that of a close friend. Though I can&#x2019;t prepare you for everything that you may (or may not) experience during your treatment, what I can do is hold your hand and guide you through the process.<br> <br>The photographic collaboration with Elizabeth was an unanticipated Silver Lining of my illness that began, as many wonderful things do, over a laugh and a cry. Shortly after my surgery, in a gesture of friendship, Elizabeth offered to photograph me. Her vision&#x2014;literally and figuratively&#x2014;was one of the brightest and most insightful lights in this dark period. When I looked in the mirror, the reflection that I saw was of the ravages of cancer. Elizabeth&#x2019;s gift of love, through her imagery, was to show my true reflection. She enabled me to see that I was still Me, full of light, love, and joy. I hope that this book, told through words and photography, will inspire, inform, and support you throughout your journey.<br> <br>&#x2014;Hollye Jacobs</p><h2>United States History: Student Edition Beginnings to 1914 2007</h2><p>United States History textbook</p><p></p><h2>Island of Shame: The Secret History of the U.S. Military Base on Diego Garcia</h2><p><p>The American military base on the island of Diego Garcia is one of the most strategically important and secretive U.S. military installations outside the United States. Located near the remote center of the Indian Ocean and accessible only by military transport, the little-known base has been instrumental in American military operations from the Cold War to the war on terror and may house a top-secret CIA prison where terror suspects are interrogated and tortured. But Diego Garcia harbors another dirty secret, one that has been kept from most of the world--until now.</p><br><br><p> <i>Island of Shame</i> is the first major book to reveal the shocking truth of how the United States conspired with Britain to forcibly expel Diego Garcia's indigenous people--the Chagossians--and deport them to slums in Mauritius and the Seychelles, where most live in dire poverty to this day. Drawing on interviews with Washington insiders, military strategists, and exiled islanders, as well as hundreds of declassified documents, David Vine exposes the secret history of Diego Garcia. He chronicles the Chagossians' dramatic, unfolding story as they struggle to survive in exile and fight to return to their homeland. Tracing U.S. foreign policy from the Cold War to the war on terror, Vine shows how the United States has forged a new and pervasive kind of empire that is quietly dominating the planet with hundreds of overseas military bases.</p><br><br><p> <i>Island of Shame</i> is an unforgettable expos� of the human costs of empire and a must-read for anyone concerned about U.S. foreign policy and its consequences. The author will donate all royalties from the sale of this book to the Chagossians.</p></p><p><p>"The story of the U.S. base on Diego Garcia, and the cruel displacement of the island's people, has long been hidden from the American public.

Over 10,000 entries. Includes pronunciations, example phrases, and usage notes. Special sections on the judicial system, legal cases, government agencies, and historic laws.&#34;</p><p>To the ordinary person, who hasn't spent three years grinding through law school, legalese gets its point across as clearly and effortlessly as a dose of ancient Greek. Right up there with medical lingo, legal jargon confuses and alienates folks, makes them feel stupid and ill at ease. A translation or two, however, can go a long way toward clearing the legal air. With concise and sensible definitions, <i>Merriam Webster's Dictionary of Law</i> converts a lease, will, or summons into standard English, and removes the intimidation factor from what is, basically, an effort at reliable communication. Been wondering about tortfeasors and arrears, peculation and naked promises, John Doe summonses and Terry stops? From ABA (American Bar Association) to Zone of Privacy ("an area or aspect of life that is held to be protected from intrusion by a specific constitutional guarantee"), the dictionary defines and explains 10,000 legal terms, allowing a ready grasp of laws, statutes, and legal procedures to anyone who knows how to crack open a dictionary.<p> Despite the title, the book is more than a mere dictionary. There's a chapter explaining the United States judicial system, a chapter discussing important legal cases, and another summarizing important laws. There's also a section on important legal agencies in the U.S., followed by the full Constitution of the United States, making this a useful family legal reference, adding clarity to news reports, assisting with homework assignments, simplifying potentially scary legal actions, and making government agencies, civil rights, and legal options less daunting and more accessible. <i>--Stephanie Gold</i></p><p> The Merriam brothers desired a continuity of editorship that would link Noah Webster's efforts with their own editions, so they selected Chauncey A. Goodrich, Webster's son-in-law and literary heir, who had been trained in lexicography by Webster himself, to be their editor in chief. Webster's son William also served as an editor of that first Merriam-Webster dictionary, which was published on September 24, 1847. </p> <p> Although Webster's work was honored, his big dictionaries had never sold well. The 1828 edition was priced at a whopping $20; in 13 years its 2,500 copies had not sold out. Similarly, the 1841 edition, only slightly more affordable at $15, moved slowly. Assuming that a lower price would increase sales, the Merriams introduced the 1847 edition at $6, and although Webster's heirs initially questioned this move, extraordinary sales that brought them $250,000 in royalties over the ensuing 25 years convinced them that the Merriams' decision had been abundantly sound. </p> <p> The first Merriam-Webster dictionary was greeted with wide acclaim. President James K. Polk, General Zachary Taylor (hero of the Mexican War and later president himself), 31 U.S. senators, and other prominent people hailed it unreservedly. In 1850 its acceptance as a resource for students began when Massachusetts ordered a copy for every school and New York placed a similar order for 10,000 copies to be used in schools throughout the state. Eventually school use would spread throughout the country. In becoming America's most trusted authority on the English language, Merriam-Webster dictionaries had taken on a role of public responsibility demanded of few other publishing companies.&nbsp;</p></p><h2>The Bones: Kivar (waterproof soft)</h2><p>A handy where-to-find-it pocket reference companion to Euclid&#39;s Elements.

He lived in the third or fourth century B. C. E., after Plato but before Apollonius of Perga.

This commentary, like each in the series, is designed to serve the church--through aid in preaching, teaching, study groups, and so forth--and demonstrate the continuing intellectual and practical viability of theological interpretation of the Bible.<br><br>Pastors and leaders of the classical church--such as Augustine, Calvin, Luther, and Wesley--interpreted the Bible theologically, believing Scripture as a whole witnessed to the gospel of Jesus Christ. Modern interpreters of the Bible questioned this premise. But in recent decades, a critical mass of theologians and biblical scholars has begun to reassert the priority of a theological reading of Scripture.<br><br>The Brazos Theological Commentary on the Bible series enlists leading theologians to read and interpret Scripture for the twenty-first century, just as the church fathers, the Reformers, and other orthodox Christians did for their times and places.</p><p>Jaroslav Pelikan initiates the forty-volume Brazos Theological Commentary on the Bible with his work on Acts. This commentary, like each in the series, is designed to serve the church--through aid in preaching, teaching, study groups, and so forth--and demonstrate the continuing intellectual and practical viability of theological interpretation of the Bible.<br><br><i>Praise for the Brazos Theological Commentary on the Bible</i><br><br>"The Brazos Theological Commentary on the Bible makes a most welcome contribution to the church, the academic world, and the general public at large. By enlisting a wide range of Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox theologians who differ on much, but who agree on the truth of the Nicene Creed, the series also represents ecumenical activity of the very best kind."<br>--Mark A. Noll, Wheaton College <br><br>"Preachers and teachers in particular, but thoughtful Christians more generally, have long lamented the slide of biblical scholarship into hyper-specialized critical studies of ancient texts in remote historical context. It is no wonder, therefore, that the Brazos Theological Commentary is being so warmly welcomed. The outstanding array of authors, beginning with Jaroslav Pelikan's splendid commentary on the Acts of the Apostles, are, at long last, reclaiming the Bible as the book of the living community of faith that is the church."<br>--Richard John Neuhaus, editor in chief, <i>First Things</i><br><br>"The Brazos Theological Commentary exists to provide an accessible authority so that the preacher's application will be a ready bandage for all the hurts of life. We who serve the pulpit want a commentary we can understand, and those who hear us expect us to give them a usable word. The Brazos Commentary is just the right level of light to make illuminating the word the joy it was meant to be."<br>--Calvin Miller, author of <i>A Hunger for the Holy </i>and <i>Loving God Up Close </i><br><br>"This new series places the accent on 'theological' and reflects current interpretive ferment marked by growing resistance to the historical-critical project. With a focus on the theological tradition, this series holds the promise of asking interpretive questions that are deeply grounded in the primal claims of faith. The rich promise of the series is indicated by the stature and erudition of the commentators."<br>--Walter Brueggemann, Columbia Theological Seminary<br><br>"What a splendid idea! Many preachers have been longing for more commentaries that are not only exegetical but theological in the best sense: arising out of the conviction that God, through his Word, still speaks in our time. For those of us who take our copies of Martin Luther's <i>Galatians </i>and Karl Barth's <i>Romans</i> from the shelves on a regular basis, this new series in that tradition promises renewed vigor for preaching, and therefore for the one, holy, catholic, and apostolic church in our time."<br>--Fleming Rutledge, author of <i>The Bible and The New York Times</i> and <i>The Seven Last Words from the Cross</i><br><br>General editor: R. R. Reno (Creighton University). Series editors: Robert W. Jenson (Center of Theological Inquiry); Robert Louis Wilken (University of Virginia); Ephraim Radner (Ascension Episcopal Church in Pueblo, Colorado); Michael Root (Lutheran Theological Southern Seminary); and George Sumner (Wycliffe College in Toronto).From the Series Preface<br><br>This series of biblical commentaries was born out of the conviction that dogma clarifies rather than obscures. The Brazos Theological Commentary on the Bible advances upon the assumption that the Nicene tradition, in all its diversity and controversy, provides the proper basis for the interpretation of the Bible as Christian Scripture. God the Father Almighty, who sends his only begotten Son to die for us and for our salvation and who raises the crucified Son in the power of the Holy Spirit so that the baptized may be joined in one body--faith in <i>this</i> God with <i>this</i> vocation of love for the world is the lens through which to view the heterogeneity and particularity of the biblical texts. <br><br>The commentators in this series were chosen because of their knowledge of and expertise in using the Christian doctrinal tradition. They are qualified by virtue of the doctrinal formation of the mental habits, for it is the conceit of this series of biblical commentaries that theological training in the Nicene tradition prepares one for biblical interpretation, and thus it is to theologians and not biblical scholars that we have turned. <br><br>The Nicene tradition does not provide a set formula for the solution of exegetical problems. The great tradition of Christian doctrine was not transcribed, bound in folio, and issued in an official, critical edition. As Augustine observed, commenting on Jer. 31:33, "The creed is learned by listening; it is written, not on stone tablets nor on any material, but on the heart." This is why Irenaeus is able to appeal to the rule of faith more than a century before the first ecumenical council, and this is why we need not itemize the contents of the Nicene tradition in order to appeal to its potency and role in the work of interpretation. <br><br>R.

And here he has succeeded magnificently. For peacemakers and warmakers alike.&#34; -- Harry G. Summers, Jr., New York Times Book Review.</p><p><b>Edward N. Luttwak</b> is a Senior Associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.Luttwak's...purpose is to make us think about what to all too many Americans has become the unthinkable. And here he has succeeded magnificently. For peacemakers and warmakers alike, <i>Strategy: The Logic of War and Peace</i> is essential reading. (Harry G. Summers, Jr. <i>New York Times Book Review</i>)<br><br>Fascinating...Luttwak succeeds admirably in revealing the complex and invariably contradictory relationship between the various levels of strategic action; our grasp of the <i>process</i> of conflict is correspondingly enhanced and the reader left properly skeptical about claims that his or that technical innovation will provide an ultimate and foolproof defense. Luttwak's achievement is therefore considerable: Like his mentor Clausewitz he has recognized that the study of war cannot be subject to the 'intellectual codification used in the [mechanical] arts and sciences.' Rather, it requires philosophical rigour and historical understanding of a kind rarely found in the narrow, ahistorical world of the scenario builder. These intellectual virtues are abundantly present in this book, and teacher and student alike can only benefit from a close reading and assessment of its central hypothesis. (J. E. Spence <i>Times Higher Education Supplement</i>)<br><br>If Edward Luttwak does not always persuade, he always provokes. In this superb book, one that will become a classic of strategy, he does both...His definitions of five levels of strategy are enriching and his historical examples fascinating. (Gregory F. Treverton <i>Foreign Affairs</i>)<br><br>A tour de force, brilliant...[Luttwak] has tried to demystify matters military, renouncing its jargon and macho banalities, and making it accessible to anyone willing to read--and to think.

Her first novel, Blackkerchief Dick, was published in 1923 when she was 19. Her first work of detective fiction was a serialized story published by the Daily Express in 1927. Entitled The White Cottage Mystery, it contained atypical themes for a woman writer of the era. Her breakthrough occurred in 1929 with the publication of The Crime at Black Dudley. This introduced Albert Campion, albeit originally as a minor character. He returned in Mystery Mile, thanks in part to pressure from her American publishers, much taken with the character. Campion proved so successful that Allingham made him the centrepiece of another 17 novels and over 20 short stories, continuing into the 1960s.</p>&#34;One of her best... vivid and witty&#34; * New York Times * &#34;Allingham captures her quintessential quiet detective Albert Campion to perfection...

(American Girl Collection)</h2><p>Williamsburg, 1775: Elizabeth Cole and her best friend Felicity Merriman are &#34;the merriest girls in Virginia&#34;--at least, that&#39;s what Felicity&#39;s father calls them. The girls&#39; favorite form of merriment is teasing Elizabeth&#39;s annoying sister Annabelle. When Annabelle Bananabelle becomes engaged, impish Felicity and very funny Elizabeth prove that they are the merriest mischief-makers in Virginia, too! But when their mischief-making heats up, they end up creating big trouble for Elizabeth. Can they find a way to cool things down quickly?</p><p>Grade 3-5&#x2013;Ten-year-old Elizabeth Cole lives in Williamsburg in 1775. She and her friend Felicity Merriman (from the Felicity books in the American Girl series) delight in teasing Elizabeths proper, but boy-crazed, 16-year-old sister, Annabelle. The pranks backfire, leading to the threat that Elizabeth will be taken to England when Annabelle marries Lord Harry Lacey. In protest, she concentrates her mischief on prissy Miss Priscilla, Harrys domineering sister. This inspires mild-mannered Harry to stand up for himself, prompting Annabelle to show a glimpse of spine, too. The book includes six pages of illustrated historical data on Courtship and Marriage in 1775. Elizabeth and Felicity are charming, well drawn, and appealing. Except for Priscilla and Harry, secondary characters are paper-doll thin. Annabelle may rise to pasteboard depth, but before the story concludes, readers find her reverting to her old ways. The book is long on historical contextual detail, and the style is highly accessible without attempting to re-create historical dialogue.<i>&#x2013;Marlene Johnson, Paradise Education Center, Surprise, AZ</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Written by well-known and respected scholars, the book, in nine core chapters, provides an introduction to a set of disorders along with overviews of current research on etiology, treatment and prevention. Prior chapters give a context for the integration of Christianity and the scientific study of psychopathology, and articulate integrative themes discussed throughout the book, providing a foundation for the concluding vision for Christian health professionals and the church. This is a unique and valuable resource for Christians studying psychology and counseling, or providing counseling services, pastoral care, Christian healing ministries or spiritual direction. Though fully capable of standing on its own, it is also a useful companion volume to <em>Modern Psychotherapies</em> by Stanton L. Jones and Richard E. Butman.</p><p>Mark Yarhouse (PsyD, Wheaton College) is the Hughes Endowed Chair and professor of psychology at Regent University where he directs the Institute for the Study of Sexual Identity and is a core faculty member in the doctoral program in clinical psychology.

I appreciate the care the authors have taken to place contemporary conceptualizations of psychopathology within the historical context of pastoral care and current church ministry, as well as to incorporate discussion of theological concepts such as the role of sin and suffering. Their organization of the material around <em>DSM-5</em> categories will help students better understand this diagnostic system, while their critiques of <em>DSM-5</em> will help enable students to understand both its benefits and limitations." (Heather Davediuk Gingrich, professor of counseling, Denver Seminary)<br><br>"This second edition of <em>Modern Psychopathologies</em> continues to be a substantial contribution to the integration literature, with distinctively Christian perspectives on pastoral care, sin, and psychopathology. I highly recommend this clearly written and comprehensive book as an integrative text for courses on psychopathology as well as on integration." (Siang-Yang Tan, professor of psychology, Fuller Theological Seminary, author of Counseling and Psychotherapy)<br><br>"The second edition of this seminal work includes helpful information regarding diagnostic changes, both large and small, in <em>DSM-5</em>. The authors remain committed to a holistic understanding of human suffering&#x2015;an approach that seeks to stimulate conversations about the complicated connections among the spiritual, psychological, religious, and secular notions of human dysfunction. Especially helpful is their concluding chapter on responsible care in an imperfect system. Students of abnormal psychology and the art of diagnosis will benefit from this useful and readable text." (James R. Beck, senior professor of counseling, Denver Seminary)<br><br>"Integrating faith with science is a significant undertaking in Christian higher education. As one who teaches Introduction to Psychopathology to beginning clinical psychology doctoral students in a faith-based program, I am consistently searching for tools to assist in the process of integration. I was summarily impressed with the first edition of this book, having used it for several years. I am excited to endorse this second edition, which brings the text up to date with current diagnostic organization and nomenclature in the <em>DSM-5</em>. The authors make integration explicit, sharing connections between historical faith traditions, current faith practices and understanding, and the latest scientific evidence from psychopathology. They outline general frameworks for understanding psychopathology from scriptural, pastoral, and scientific lenses. They then move to nuanced exploration of specific groupings of disorders, maintaining this multiple-lens approach. This allows for the reader to consider pathology from various perspectives and begin the process of integration. I have not found a better tool for assisting students with integration around issues of psychopathology. I highly recommend this text." (David M. Cimbora, professor and associate dean of doctoral programs, Rosemead School of Psychology, Biola University)<br><br>"This book provides Christians in the helping professions with a solid scaffolding for integrating Christian doctrine and practice with psychopathology. The authors deal masterfully with the thorny and complex problem of the relationship between sin and psychopathology as well as the related issue of responsibility. This book combines the best and most recent advances in the understanding of psychopathology with the richness of Christian thought on human suffering, helping to create a vision for a Christian response that moves beyond symptom reduction to flourishing. I highly recommend this book to pastors and therapists seeking to more thoughtfully address human brokenness in all its varieties." (M. Elizabeth Lewis Hall, professor of psychology, Rosemead School of Psychology, Biola University)<br><br>"Finally! A comprehensive Christian perspective on abnormal psychology. This book is grounded, insightful, biblical, practical, accessible&#x2015;and long overdue. Everyone interested in exploring psychopathology from a Christian worldview will relish reading this updated edition of the book." (Les Parrott, department of psychology, Seattle Pacific University, author of Saving Your Marriage Before It Starts)<br><br>"Books on psychopathology are a dime a dozen. However, no other volume takes into consideration the centuries-old tradition of the treatment of the mentally ill by priests and pastors as well as carefully thought-out applied theologies relating sin to human frailty. When these considerations are combined with a definitive survey of contemporary theory and research, we have a seminal volume that will be a standard for years to come. I cannot think of a volume that better balances tradition with practice." (H. Newton Malony, MDiv, Ph.D., Senior Professor, Graduate School of Psychology, Fuller Theological Seminary)<br><br>"Over the past century, the church and the behavioral sciences have sometimes been at odds over the causes and treatments of mental disorders. This work offers a well-reasoned rapprochement that takes seriously the long tradition of pastoral care and counseling within the church as well as the increasing body of knowledge being amassed in the biopsychosocial sciences."

Sanders, PhD, Clinical Psychologist and former Executive Director of Christian Association for Psychological Studies (CAPS))</p><h2>A Pictorial History of Chinese Architecture: A Study of the Development of Its Structural System and the Evolution of Its Types</h2><p>Liang Ssu-ch'eng (1901-1972) was a pioneer in the scientific study of Chinese architectural history. He virtually created this field in China, and most of its current practitioners are his students. The book, which he wrote in English for a Western public and originally intended to publish in the 1940s, provides a rare record and analysis of temples, pagodas, tombs, bridges, and imperial palaces that are China's architectural heritage. It is a record that could not be duplicated today because a number of the structures have since been altered or demolished.<br> <br> With his co-workers, Liang combed the countryside for ancient buildings which he photographed with his Leica camera and recorded in large, detailed architectural drawings of plans, elevations, and cross-sections. These drawings are a text in themselves. Bearing captions in Chinese and English, they teach fundamental lessons about the anatomy of Chinese structures.<br> <br> Liang's account covers the origin of Chinese architecture and its two surviving basic handbooks from the 12th and 18th centuries; architecture of the pre-Buddhist period; cave temples; buildings in wood traced through several periods of stylistic development from c. 850 to 1911; Buddhist pagodas (most of the surviving pagodas are masonry structures) from simple square plans to those that are multi-storied and eaved; and other masonry structures such as tombs, vaulted buildings, bridges; terraces; and gateways.<br> <br> For most of his life, Liang Ssu-ch'eng lived in China, but as a young man he received his architectural training at the University of Pennsylvania. Wilma and John K. Fairbank first met him in China in 1932. During his last visit to the United States, in 1947 as a Visiting Professor at Yale, Mrs. Fairbank agreed to edit his manuscript and to help him find an American publisher. However, a combination of political and personal circumstances, compounded by the loss of the original drawings and photographs (they were only rediscovered in 1980) made publication of this unusual project impossible until now.</p><p></p><h2>Babar and Zephir (The Babar Books)</h2><p>In the most fantastical of the classic Babar stories, we follow Zephir, Babar&#x2019;s monkey friend, home on school holiday. The monkey princess, Isabelle, has been kidnapped by the horned monster Polomoche, and everyone is very worried. But Zephir, with the help of a tiny mermaid named Eleanore, is certain that he can save the princess himself.</p><p></p><h2>THE SURPASSING GREATNESS OF HIS POWER</h2><p>Rick Joyner explains how Christians can tap the power of the Divine within them for use against the challenges and difficulties of life in tumultous times.</p><p>Rick Joyner is the founder and executive director of Morning Star Publications and Ministries in Charlotte, North Carolina.

After the war, he married and raised a family in southern California. He became a wildcatter and made and lost a fortune exploring for oil. He also continued his career as an aviation pioneer, founding Western Air Express, a cargo airline that became a commercial carrier, in the 1950s. He died in 1970.&#34;It is surprising that this remarkable World War I memoir, written shortly after 1918, has remained unpublished for 82 years. Author Libby survived the war and died in 1970, but he left a powerful account of his three years of aerial combat over the trenches in France, first as an observer/gunner and later as a pilot in the Royal Flying Corps. Libby was an American cowboy from Colorado. By 1914, at age 22, he was in Canada and joined the Canadian Army for the travel and adventure offered by a world war. The first half of the book is Libby's tale of cowpunching and horsebreaking in the last decades of the Old West. Even better, however, is the second half, where he vividly relates his at once hilarious and terrifying experiences as an American flying in a British aircraft against swarms of German fighter planes. Credited with 24 aerial victories, Libby was the first American to be awarded England's Military Cross for valor, presented by King George V himself. By volunteering before America entered the war, Libby lost his citizenship, but he clearly has no regrets. This colorful, stirring memoir leaves no doubt that he made the right decision, and it serves as a grim reminder of the archaic chivalry and cold-blooded nature of early aerial warfare.

It&#39;s powerful navy and army posed a mortal threat. In 1778, the decision was made to abandon the New England states in favor of conquering the Southern states first.</p><p>Having underestimated the resolve and strength of the Continental Army in New England, Great Britain adopts a new strategy in the war to subdue the American rebels. British general Sir Henry Clinton leads British and German forces in an invasion of the South, hoping to use success there as a springboard to subdue the Northern colonies. <p>At first the British Southern campaign seems an unqualified success when in December 1778, American general Benjamin Lincoln surrenders his entire command army at Savannah, Georgia, and a second army at Charleston, South Carolina. But the British are not prepared for the fierce resistance from the common people in the Southern colonies. Famed guerrilla fighters Dan Morgan, Nathanael Greene, and Frances Marion (the Swamp Fox) use frontier skills and tactics learned in Indian warfare to erode the British forces and wear down British resolve. </p><p>Meanwhile, Benedict Arnold enters into treasonous negotiations to surrender Fort West Point to the British, thus betraying the American cause and earning for himself the ignominious title of traitor. </p><p>Finally, with the French providing much-needed financial, naval, and military aid, General Washington traps the British at Yorktown, where American and French forces mount a prolonged siege and compel the surrender of General Charles Cornwallis. The embittered and once-proud British see the American victory as evidence that the world has truly been "turned upside down." </p><p>In this sixth volume of his acclaimed Prelude to Glory series, author Ron Carter has crafted another compelling chapter in his depiction of the Revolutionary War. Readers will be interested to learn the fates of beloved fictional characters-Brigitte Dunson and her British captain Richard Buchanan, Eli Stroud and Mary Flint, and childhood sweethearts Matthew Dunson and Kathleen Thorpe. Through their stories and others, Carter brings to vivid life the legendary places, people, and battles that were part of America's quest for liberty and independence.</p>Ron Carter graduated from Brigham Young University and attended law school at George Washington University and the University of Utah. He retired as research and writing director for the Superior Court system in Los Angeles County, California, in 1999.

The series first appeared in French in Le Petit Vingtieme, a children's supplement to the Belgian newspaper Le Vingtieme Siecle on 10 January 1929. Set in a painstakingly researched world closely mirroring our own, Herge's Tintin series continues to be a favorite of readers and critics alike 80 years later.<br>The hero of the series is Tintin, a young Belgian reporter. He is aided in his adventures from the beginning by his faithful fox terrier dog Snowy (Milou in French). Later, popular additions to the cast included the brash, cynical and grumpy Captain Haddock, the bright but hearing-impaired Professor Calculus (Professeur Tournesol) and other colorful supporting characters such as the incompetent detectives Thomson and Thompson (Dupond et Dupont). Herge himself features in several of the comics as a background character; as do his assistants in some instances.<br>The success of the series saw the serialized strips collected into a series of albums (24 in all), spun into a successful magazine and adapted for film and theatre. The series is one of the most popular European comics of the 20th century, with translations published in over 50 languages and more than 200 million copies of the books sold to date. <br>The comic strip series has long been admired for its clean, expressive drawings in Herge's signature ligne claire style. Engaging, well-researched plots straddle a variety of genres: swashbuckling adventures with elements of fantasy, mysteries, political thrillers, and science fiction. The stories within the Tintin series always feature slapstick humor, accompanied in later albums by sophisticated satire, and political and cultural commentary.</p><p>Herge (Georges Remi) was born in Brussels in 1907. Over the course of 54 years he completed 23 albums of The Adventures of Tintin series, which is now considered to be one of the greatest, if not the greatest, comics series of all time. With translations published in over 80 languages, more than 230 million copies sold worldwide and a Hollywood movie to its name, Tintin dominates the Comics and Graphic Novels chart even today. Sadly, Herge died in 1983, leaving his 24th album, Tintin and Alph-Art, unfinished, but his hero continues to be one of the most iconic characters in both adult and children&#39;s fiction.</p><h2>A Traveller&#39;s History of Poland</h2><p>Poland is a major European country with over 38 million inhabitants and a land area comparable to Spain. It has played a major role in European history but its subjugation by foreign powers in the nineteenth century and during the Cold War eclipsed Poland in the minds of many in Western Europe and the United States. Throughout its long and diverse history it has been a meeting place of many cultures and has given the world the poetry of Czeslaw Milosz, the music of Chopin, and the scientific discoveries of Copernicus and Marie Curie, to name but a few. <p>In A Traveller's History of Poland, John Radzilowski vividly describes the beginnings of the country, first fragmented then reborn to overcome the aggression of the Teutonic Knights and its greedy neighbors. Poland enjoyed a Golden Age in the fifteen and sixteenth centuries but a gradual decline then led to Poland losing its autonomy despite winning many battles with its army's legendary military skill and gallantry. Yet the spirit of the country and its people lived on. Since the horrors of the Second World War and Soviet control, Poland has gradually regained its rightful place in Europe, joining NATO in 1999 and in May 2004, the EU. It is playing a new role on the European and international stage. This makes now an ideal time to introduce students and travellers to Poland and its complex history through the pages of this Traveller's History. </p><p>The book includes a full chronology, a list of monarchs and rulers, a gazetteer, historical maps and is fully illustrated.</p></p><p>John Radzilowski is a writer and historian. He received his Ph.D. in history in 1999 with a specialization in East European History. He has written and spoken widely on Polish history and current affairs. He is the author or co-author of several books on Polish themes, including: Poland's Transformation, Spanish Carlism and Polish Nationalism, The Eagle and the Cross: A History of the Polish Roman Catholic Union of America. His articles have appeared in both Polish and English periodicals and reference works. In 1998 he received the Cavalier's Cross of the Order of Merit from the President of the Republic of Poland. <p>Series Editor Professor Denis Judd is a graduate of Oxford, a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society and Professor of History at the London Metropolitan University.

Each chapter introduces a concept such as "the first rock group-Igneous 'Iggy,' Sedimentary 'Sed,' and Metamorphic 'Morph'!" Ways to find and places to observe these types of rock are suggested. Activities such as creating a sand sculpture or playing "Rock Tic-Tac-Toe" are included. Sidebars give additional information about geologists, language links ("blow your top" or "petrified"), famous formations, scientific controversies, and how to think like a scientist. The text is witty but conveys much factual material. The experiments can be done easily with household items and include safety precautions. Whether making the standard chemical volcano, catching falling stars, or creating a mini glacier, readers will find much of interest here. The book is illustrated with red-and-purple tinted cartoons and photographs. The experiments are similar to those found in Alan Anderson's Geology Crafts for Kids (Lark, 1996), but Blobaum's offering is presented in a much more informal format.<br><i>Kathryn Kosiorek, Cuyahoga County Public Library, Brooklyn, OH </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc."The text is witty yet conveys much factual material ... readers will find much of interest here." --<i>School Library Journal</i></p><h2>Missed Connections: Love, Lost &amp; Found</h2><p>In her first book for adults, the artist Sophie Blackall creates a deeply felt, poignant book about love&#x2014;a book that captures the mystery, the yearning, at times the cosmic humor behind the &#x201c;what if?&#x201d; of a missed connection.<br><br>Like a message in a bottle, a &#x201c;missed connection" classified (usually posted on a website) is an attempt however far-fetched, by one stranger to reach another on the strength of a remembered glance, smile, or blue hat.

The paintings are extraordinary: delicate yet full of feeling, each springing from one little detail of the post into a fully imagined world.

So when James Campbell&#x2019;s cousin Heimo Korth asked him to spend a summer building a cabin in the rugged Interior, Campbell hesitated about inviting his fifteen-year-old daughter, Aidan, to join him: Would she be able to withstand clouds of mosquitoes, the threat of grizzlies, bathing in an ice-cold river, and hours of grueling labor peeling and hauling logs? <br><br>But once there, Aidan embraced the wild. She even agreed to return a few months later to help the Korths work their traplines and hunt for caribou and moose. Despite windchills of 50 degrees below zero, father and daughter ventured out daily to track, hunt, and trap. Under the supervision of Edna, Heimo&#x2019;s Yupik Eskimo wife, Aidan grew more confident in the woods. <br><br>Campbell knew that in traditional Eskimo cultures, some daughters earned a rite of passage usually reserved for young men. So he decided to take Aidan back to Alaska one final time before she left home. It would be their third and most ambitious trip, backpacking over Alaska&#x2019;s Brooks Range to the headwaters of the mighty Hulahula River, where they would assemble a folding canoe and paddle to the Arctic Ocean. The journey would test them, and their relationship, in one of the planet&#x2019;s most remote places: a land of wolves, musk oxen, Dall sheep, golden&nbsp;eagles, and polar bears.<br><br> At turns poignant and humorous, <i>Braving It </i>is an ode to America&#x2019;s disappearing wilderness and a profound meditation on what it means for a child to grow up&#x2014;and a parent to finally, fully let go.</p><p>JAMES CAMPBELL is the author of <i>The Final Frontiersman </i>and <i>The Ghost Mountain Boys</i>. He has written for <i>Outside </i>magazine, <i>National Geographic Adventure</i>, <i>Men&#x2019;s Journal</i>, <i>Audubon</i>, and many other publications.Prologue&nbsp;<br><br>MY DAUGHTER AIDAN HADN&#x2019;T YET entered kindergarten when I made a series of trips to the Alaskan Arctic while researching and writing my first book. She loved my stories, and as she listened, she said that when she was a &#x201c;big girl&#x201d; she hoped to join me in Alaska. I told her that, yes, one day we would go together. She accepted this answer until her freshman year in high school, when she began to remind me of my promise on what seemed like a weekly basis.<br><br>The more I thought about it, the more it seemed like the right time to take her on an Alaskan adventure, or perhaps a series of adventures. In traditional Eskimo cultures, although gender roles were well defined, adolescent girls would sometimes accompany their fathers on extensive hunting and trapping trips while boys stayed behind in the village. The idea was that it was important for boys and girls to switch roles in order to acquire the others&#x2019; life skills. Boys would learn to sew, tan, weave, and cook, and girls would learn how to hunt, survive in the wilderness, and make tools and weapons. I believed that, at fifteen, Aidan was ready for a similar experience. She would be old enough to appreciate it and responsible enough to carry her own weight. Perhaps, too, her encounter with wilderness would evoke the same feelings of wonder it had in me.<br><br>From John Muir and Aldo Leopold (fellow Wisconsinites) to Rachel Carson, Annie Dillard, and Wendell Berry, literature teems with musings on the power of nature. Leopold memorably called it &#x201c;meat from God.&#x201d; Edward Abbey called wilderness a &#x201c;necessity of the human spirit.&#x201d; Henry David Thoreau&#x2019;s saying &#x201c;In Wildness is the preservation of the World&#x201d; makes the bold claim not that we must save wildness but that wildness has the potential to save us.<br><br>In preparation for our adventure I asked Aidan to read Wallace Stegner&#x2019;s &#x201c;Wilderness Letter.&#x201d; In it Stegner writes about wild country as &#x201c;a part of the geography of hope.&#x201d; I&#x2019;d always loved that line&#x2014;&#x201c;the geography of hope.&#x201d; But in rereading the letter before passing it on to Aidan, I was drawn to another phrase: &#x201c;the birth of awe.&#x201d; Yes, I thought, in Alaska, Aidan might truly feel awe. Short of that, I wanted her to learn concrete life lessons in common sense, self-sufficiency, confidence, and competence.<br><br>By February 2013, after deciding to do a self-guided, three-week paddling trip somewhere in Arctic Alaska, we were auditioning rivers, running them in our imaginations. There was the Firth, a mighty river of steep canyons that straddles the border between northeastern Alaska and Canada; the Hulahula, a scenic, hundred-mile-long stretch of water that tumbles from the Romanzof Mountains of the Brooks Range to the Arctic Ocean; the Canning, which parallels the Hulahula and runs along the western border of the 19.5-million-acre Arctic National Wildlife Refuge; xvthe Sheenjek, which in 1956 motivated environmentalists Olaus and Mardy Murie to develop the idea of a wilderness preserve in the Arctic; and, finally, the Porcupine, a six-hundred-mile historic trade route that winds through dense boreal forest en route from Dawson City in Canada&#x2019;s Yukon Territory to the Gwich&#x2019;in Athabaskan community of Old Crow, also in the Yukon Territory, and then southwest into Alaska.<br><br>All are wild and beautiful rivers with the ability to inspire and terrify. That is the thing about awe: beauty and fear are inseparable. The Inupiat, of Alaska&#x2019;s harsh Arctic coast, have a word to express the duality: uniari, &#x201c;nervous awe.&#x201d; The Tununirmiut of Baffin Bay call it ilira, and distinguish between it and the raw fear&#x2014;kappia&#x2014;that one might feel if he or she were thrown from a canoe into an icy Arctic river.<br><br>In April we pored over maps and began to assemble our gear. Then, in May, I got a call. Heimo and Edna Korth, my cousin and his wife, about whom I&#x2019;d written The Final Frontiersman, had just left the bush for the village of Fort Yukon, on the Yukon River, where they traditionally spend the summer months. For the rest of the year the Korths live 120 miles to the north, deep in the foothills of the Brooks Range, where they raised three daughters. Heimo and Edna are some of the last hunter-trapper-gatherers living in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.<br><br>Heimo wanted to know if I&#x2019;d be willing to come up in July and August to help him build a new cabin on the Coleen River. Earlier that month, during spring breakup, as the river ice thawed and melted, the Coleen River had rerouted itself, spilling into a side channel; the Korths&#x2019; current cabin, which sat along the banks of that channel, was in jeopardy of being washed away. Heimo explained that he had already done some of the preliminary work. He&#x2019;d picked out the new site upriver, cleared some of the trees, and sketched the outline of the cabin with an axe and a shovel. His only caveat was that we&#x2019;d have a lot of work and we&#x2019;d have to do it fast to get most of the cabin built before the cold came.<br><br>I was tempted by the invitation. I&#x2019;d always wanted to build a cabin in the woods, nursing dreams of heading to Canada or Alaska and living off the land, but as a young man I instead went to an eastern city for college. It was a good place, but hardly an appropriate training ground for a mountain man. After college I got sidetracked, following the beaten professional path to Chicago and New York, and eventually left the path for the mountains of Colorado. Then, a decade and a half later, a deep homing instinct led me to return to rural Wisconsin.<br><br>In each place I lived I found joy. In Colorado I went to graduate school, which I paid for by working construction and landscaping, and sometimes helping out an old rancher whose sons had left for the city. In return the rancher gave me some first-edition Zane Grey novels from his book collection. But I had never followed the needle pull of the compass north as Heimo had.<br><br>I mulled Heimo&#x2019;s offer over for a few days before approaching my wife, Elizabeth, with an idea: what if Aidan and I were to go up together to help him? Elizabeth had never been a supporter of our Alaskan river trip idea and viewed this new plan with equal skepticism. Aidan was not new to the wilderness, but she still had lots to learn, and Elizabeth thought we should start out with something less risky&#x2014;the Boundary Waters, for instance. The Boundary Waters is a 1.3-million-acre wilderness, with twelve hundred miles of canoe routes, that straddles the border between Minnesota and Ontario. It&#x2019;s remote country&#x2014;by Lower 48 standards&#x2014;but it is not Alaska.<br><br>Elizabeth&#x2019;s biggest worry: bears. Like many other Lower 48ers, my wife believes that nearly every Alaskan thicket hides an angry, frothing-at-the-mouth grizzly. She&#x2019;s no city gal, either. She&#x2019;s done her time in the woods. But the thought of her oldest daughter wandering around in bear country scared her. She'd read that a grizzly kills in a gruesome fashion, delivering a deadly blow to the head with a force akin to a twelve-pound splitting maul swung by an NFL linebacker, before seizing the back of its prey&#x2019;s neck and severing its spine. Grizzlies have a bite force of over 8 million pascals, a metric unit of pressure, powerful enough to crush a bowling ball. Elizabeth wondered why I would want to risk taking Aidan to Alaska, especially when she could learn the kinds of life skills I was talking about right here at home.<br><br>By that, Elizabeth meant that we have land where we keep bees and tend a garden, pick cherries, apples, mulberries, and plums for jam. There is no shortage of work. We were getting chickens, so there was a chicken coop and run to build, wood to cut and split, and perhaps one day maple trees to tap and sheep&#x2019;s milk cheese to make. Nevertheless, I could tell that Elizabeth was wavering. When she made me promise that wherever Aidan went I would be beside her with a shotgun, loaded with lead slugs, I knew that she had decided to let Aidan join me. Now I had to hope that Heimo and Edna would, too.<br><br>Heimo didn&#x2019;t know Aidan&#x2014;his second cousin once removed&#x2014;from Adam, and when I called to broach the possibility of her coming, he proved leery of taking on a teenage girl. He was full of questions that boiled down to just one: could she hack it?<br><br>I made a modest pitch. I am one of my daughter&#x2019;s biggest fans, and occasionally one of her toughest critics, but I didn&#x2019;t want to raise expectations. I told Heimo she might prove herself useful. After thinking it over for a couple weeks, he called back: he and Edna were willing to give Aidan a chance.<br><br>I still had to sell Aidan&#x2014;and perhaps myself&#x2014;on the experience. We&#x2019;d be swapping a river trip for a three-and-a-half-week stint of cabin building. Would there be opportunity for Stegner&#x2019;s &#x201c;birth of awe&#x201d;?<br><br>I was straight with her about the experience; I didn&#x2019;t sugarcoat it. It would be hard, sweaty, and dirty work. We would get blistered, scratched, and scraped limbing trees and lugging them out of the woods. There would be bugs&#x2014;clouds of them. We would be wearing the same pair of work clothes day in and day out, and after a while the animal smell of our own bodies would offend us. We would encounter Nature with a capital N, including the possibility of running across a grizzly, Ursus arctos horribilis, or a cow moose protecting her calf.<br><br>For tools, we would be using axes, drawknives, pickaxes, and saws. If one of us got cut badly, we&#x2019;d have to make an emergency call by satellite phone and hope that someone could come and airlift us out. Because the nearest hospital is two hundred and fifty miles away, in Fairbanks, we would be a minimum of twelve to twenty-four hours from medical help. The remoteness of where we would be, and what that meant in case of emergency, could not be overemphasized. In 2012, two scientists from the University of Alaska, Fairbanks&#x2019; Geophysical Institute identified the Coleen River as the most isolated spot in mainland Alaska. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is roughly the size of South Carolina or the country of Austria, and combined with the adjacent Ivvavik and Vuntut National Parks in Canada, it is part of one of the largest protected ecosystems in the world.<br><br>Aidan had lots of questions, many more than when we were planning the river trip. She is a curious, inquiring girl, a committed student of the Socratic method: ask and you will be enlightened. When she&#x2019;s nervous or uncomfortable, the questions multiply. Heimo&#x2019;s invitation somehow made Alaska real for her, and her questions came in a torrent, like a spring cloudburst. How dangerous would it be? Would we have a first aid kit? What would we eat? What would we do about the bugs, the bears? Would a grizzly maul you? Kill you? How would we protect ourselves? Where would we get our drinking water? What if we got giardia? Would she be able to use the satellite phone to call home? Would there be a generator to charge her Kindle? Though she knew some of the answers, she asked the questions anyway. But then one day, after nearly two weeks of her hounding me, the barrage ended. She had reached a saturation point. A week later she announced with little ceremony, &#x201c;Dad, I want to go.&#x201d; She sounded so confident that I began to worry.<br><br>Aidan, you see, is firstborn and eager to please. As a little girl she&#x2019;d ask me, &#x201c;Daddy, do you wish that I had been a boy? Is that why you gave me a boy&#x2019;s name?&#x201d; Perhaps she heard the teasing from my buddies. It&#x2019;s a Gaelic name&#x2014;Aidan&#x2014;meaning &#x201c;little fire,&#x201d; and is used mostly for males. My friends insisted that I wanted a son so bad I gave her a boy&#x2019;s name. By the time Aidan was two, I knew that was a lot of bunk. She was my sidekick. She was a tomboy, but still a girl who loved dolls, tea parties, and feather boas.<br><br>In answer to her question about whether or not I wished I&#x2019;d had a son, I chose to be honest with her. I told her that I&#x2019;d dreamed of having a boy, but not long after she came into the world, I knew I could never love a son more than I loved her.<br><br>Despite my reassurances, in school she made sure she could throw a football as well as the boys, field the highest punts, and run the fastest and longest. With a BB gun, and later a .22 rifle, she was determined to be a deadeye. When I brought home ducks, geese, or pheasants I&#x2019;d shot, she&#x2019;d get right in there and watch up close while I cleaned them. I&#x2019;d offer her a brief biology lesson as she held the still-warm heart in her hands.<br><br>When she was seven I gave her the nickname Cap. Two years earlier, I&#x2019;d started reading books to her in bed before school&#x2014;everything from Kate DiCamillo and Mark Twain to J. R. R. Tolkien and Laura Ingalls Wilder. Her favorite of Wilder&#x2019;s books was The Long Winter, set in South Dakota during the brutal winter of 1880&#x2013;81. When the train stops delivering food to the Ingallses&#x2019; town, Pa Ingalls and the townspeople worry that they will starve until two young men, Cap Garland and Almanzo Wilder, make a dangerous trip across the prairie to bargain with a farmer for a supply of wheat. They return with enough to last the town through the winter. I told Aidan that she was my Cap Garland. At the time, I didn&#x2019;t realize the dynamic I was setting up: Aidan trying to fill the character&#x2019;s brave and determined shoes. But she never showed any signs of crumbling under the weight of her nickname. Actually, I think she was proud. She felt that I saw her as she wanted to be seen.<br><br>As a teenager, she&#x2019;s no different than she was in grade school. She still puts 100 percent into everything she does, so much so that occasionally she can be blindly driven, believing there&#x2019;s a straight line between commitment and success. Being goal-oriented and ambitious doesn&#x2019;t equip one to deal with the reality that sometimes, despite one&#x2019;s efforts, things don&#x2019;t work out as planned. I felt that a wilderness experience would teach Aidan about adaptability. In rural Alaska, Murphy&#x2019;s law is a near constant, a state of uncertainty that many kids these days are ill-equipped to handle. Between organized sports and school, their lives are planned, and managed, to a T. Someone always seems to be hovering, ready to dispense advice, problem-solving instructions, and directions. Decisions are made for them by principals, teachers, coaches, intructors, and us, their parents. Being in the woods, by contrast, is all about improvising.<br><br>My greatest hope for Aidan was that her encounter with a new world, most especially a wild one, would be one of the defining moments of her life&#x2014;that the Alaskan Arctic would knee her out of her comfort zone and, simultaneously, throw her for a joyful loop. In reality, I had no idea what obstacles we would face, nor did I know how Aidan would react to them. Would we be taking on too much? Was I being unrealistic, irresponsible even, in thinking that I could take my teenage daughter to the remote wilds of the Alaskan Arctic?</p><h2>The Honest Real Estate Agent: A Training Guide for a Successful First Year and Beyond as a Real Estate Agent</h2><p>This edition is no longer for sale.&nbsp; The Brand New Third&nbsp;Edition is now available on Amazon.</p><p>Why do so many&nbsp;Real Estate Agents fail in their first year?&nbsp; 75% of new Agents don't make it to their second year.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; It's very simple.&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor training and mentoring.&nbsp; Real Estate Schools teach their students how to pass the state exam but they do not teach their students how to succeed in the real estate industry.&nbsp; This is very disappointing but it's the reality.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're serious about your real estate career and you want an edge over your competition&nbsp;then this book will help you.&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish you the best in your career.&nbsp; Mario JannatpourWhen I started in Real Estate Practices and Principles four years ago I spent a lot of time looking up information online about becoming a real estate agent. &nbsp;I came across Mario's YouTube channel and I really liked it. &nbsp;I was drawn to the idea of an honest real estate agent and the straight-forward way in which Mario made the videos was easy to watch. &nbsp;I wasn't sure what it was going to be like to become a real estate agent, it seemed like a neat profession where I would get to interact with a lot of people while helping them with a major life milestone. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I didn't have any kind of business background and had a bit of a negative attitude toward business and making money. &nbsp;I thought that a lot of people did dishonest things in order to have high levels of success in business. &nbsp;I was really hoping that there would be some way to do this business in an honest way. &nbsp;I decided that I was going to be an honest real estate agent even if it meant taking a pay cut. &nbsp;Through watching Mario's material on YouTube and reading his book what I found is that there was really no need to think that way. In fact being an honest real estate agent is really the best way to be successful in this industry. <br>&nbsp;<br>Honesty is very important if you are focused on the long term growth of your business. People really don't care about your logo, your web site, the clothes you are wearing, or what type of car you drive. &nbsp;All they really care about is whether they can trust you. &nbsp;So you really should focus on building relationships and keeping in touch.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>If someone views you as dishonest they are not going to want to stay in touch with you and refer you more business. &nbsp;It is a good idea to constantly look for new people to do business with especially when you are new. &nbsp;Once someone works with you if they had a good experience they will call you again when they need you and will refer all of their friends and family to you. &nbsp;It's important to view every client this way and focus on what is best for them.

A grimoire follows each story with instructions on how to reenact the lessons and replicate the rituals. These grimoires are the next best thing to viewing a magician's personal Book of Shadows, which contains knowledge specially reserved for a chosen apprentice.</p></p><p>Part adventure tale and part <i>grimoire</i>, <i>The Lost Books of Merlyn</i> remains true to the Druids' method of wrapping important knowledge in a story. Monroe's tale of the British Celts, their conflict with the Romans, and the last days of King Arthur, recounts the demise of the Druids but reveals the hope of their resurrection today. Coupled with an abundance of spells, charms, and sacred rites, this is more than just a well-written fantasy, more than just a well-stocked spell book. <i>The Lost Books of Merlyn</i> is both teacher and course. Whether you read it as a work of fiction or dig for a deeper meaning, you will hear a voice in these pages speaking to you as Merlyn speaks to the author: "Now, at last, it is your turn to understand what has already been lived, and what may come of it." <i>--Brian Patterson</i>In ancient Britain, the natives followed a religion based on the Goddess of the Moon. When the ancient Druids came with the Celts to the British Isles, they brought with them solar worship of a Sun God. Rather than force their beliefs onto the people, they combined the two, becoming the Priests of this all-encompassing faith. Today, what we base on these ancient traditions is called Celtic Wicca or Witchcraft. <br> <br>There are many books written by scholars about the Druids. <i>The Lost Books of Merlyn</i> is also written by a scholar of the ancient teachings, but with one difference: Douglas Monroe presents the information so that you can use it today, for personal transformation and growth. <br> <br>There are three sections or "books" here which are derived from an ancient manuscript called "The Book of Pheryllt." He uses the ancient texts to recreate the lore and legends of the ancient Celts. But this is not just a book of stories. Within each story is the wisdom of the Druids. <br> <br>When the Druids roamed the Celtic lands, people knew the meanings within their stories. Today, much of that knowledge has been forgotten. So at the end of each section Douglas includes explicit instructions you can use to transform your life. He includes oracles and protection rituals, healing herbs, and musical secrets, how to tap into the energy of the earth, your own energy and even how to work with your dreams and astral project. He also reveals the ancient ways of evocation and the secrets of plants, herbs, and the sources of the Charms of Making (popularized in a movie). <br> <br>Isn't it time you went back to the source? If you're involved or interested in any form of Celtic Wicca, I think you're going to love this book.<br></p><h2>Puritan Boston and Quaker Philadelphia: Two Protestant Ethics and the Spirit of Class Authority and Leadership</h2><p>Explores the distinct differences between the Boston Brahmin and the Proper Philadelphian</p><p><p><em>E.

This is the illustrated history of that rugged aircraft which eventually saw service in the air forces of Australia, Canada, China, Czechoslovakia, England, France, Holland and South Africa besides the USA. Between its first production in 1939 and the close of the war in 1945 over 18,000 of the B-24&#39;s and the Navy equivalents, the Privateers, flew on combat missions that earned them a permanent place in the annals of military history. From the blackened skies above Ploesti to the crumbling defenses of the Japanese homeland, from the arid deserts of Africa to the endless water of the Pacific, the Liberators seemed to be everywhere the action was. Described here, the record of their performance in those different campaigns is a fitting tribute to the heroic airmen who flew them, bringing destruction to the enemy&#39;s warmaking capacity frequently at the cost of their own lives. But the story of the B-24&#39;s does not end with planes and crews, and the book also acknowledges the contributions of the literally millions of men and women who were involved in building and maintaining the Liberators throughout their long career. Highlighting the story are over 250 black-and-white combat photographs and four pages of full-color paintings by the noted aviation artist, John Preston, illustrating B-24&#39;s in combat markings and camouflage as well as the different units that manned them. In addition, an appendix of Liberator Production Number Lists and Specifications, an Aircraft Index and a General Index, and a list of veterans interviewed by the author make this an unmatched combat log of the most versatile bomber of World War II.</p><p></p><h2>Moving Off the Map: A Field Guide to Changing the Congregation</h2><p><p>In his book <em>Kicking Habits: Welcome Relief for Addicted Churches</em>, Thomas Bandy provided the "big picture" of the five stages of congregational renewal and transformation.

Told from the Japanese perspective, The Rising Sun is, in the author s words, a factual saga of people caught up in the flood of the most overwhelming war of mankind, told as it happened muddled, ennobling, disgraceful, frustrating, full of paradox. In weaving together the historical facts and human drama leading up to and culminating in the war in the Pacific, Toland crafts a riveting and unbiased narrative history. In his Foreword, Toland says that if we are to draw any conclusion from The Rising Sun, it is that there are no simple lessons in history, that it is human nature that repeats itself, not history.</p><p>&#x201c;[It] is quite possibly the most readable, yet informative account of the Pacific war.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Chicago Sun-Times</i><br><br>&#x201c;Unbelievably rich . . . readable and exciting . . . The best parts of [Toland&#x2019;s] book are not the battle scenes but the intimate view he gives of the highest reaches of Tokyo politics.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Newsweek<br></i><br>&#x201c;Similar in scope to William Shirer&#x2019;s <i>The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich</i>. Toland&#x2019;s book is fresh and dramatic throughout. <b>The Rising Sun</b> is not only a blood-and-guts action story, it also presents for the first time a great deal of fresh information.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Chicago Sun-Times</i>John Toland is a world-famous historian whose books include: Battle: The Story of the Bulge, Adolf Hitler, Infamy: Pearl Harbor and its Aftermath and No Man&#39;s Land: The Last Year of the Great War.</p><h2>Apples</h2><p>All about apples, from pollination to picking and eating.</p><p>Gail Gibbons has published close to fifty distinguished nonfiction titles with Holiday House. According to &#34;The Washington Post&#34;, &#34;Gail Gibbons has taught more preschoolers and early readers about the world than any other children&#39;s writer-illustrator.&#34; She lives in Vermont. Her website is www.gailgibbons.comThis colorful and accessible title offers the scientific as well as the practical for the beginning reader. Gibbons (My Baseball Book, p. 475, etc.) provides a brief history of the apple, an explanation of how the apple grows from flower to fruit, and how apples are picked, processed, and sold. She also provides a recipe for apple pie, shows how an apple press makes apple cider, and illustrates some popular apple varieties. Each page has only a few lines of text, and a full-color drawing. For example, Gibbons states: "An apple is a firm, crisp fleshy fruit with a hard center called a core. The core has five seed chambers." The accompanying illustration shows an apple inside and out, with core, stem, skin, seed chambers, and seeds carefully labeled. She concludes with additional statistics and facts about apples. Betsy Maestro's How Do Apples Grow (1992), a Let's-Read-and-Find Out Science title on the same reading level, provides much more detail on the development of the apple, discussing and labeling flower parts pollen, pollination, and the developing fruit. This title illustrates more apple varieties, and includes a recipe. School and public libraries will certainly welcome this addition to the crop.

The twin-masted courier ship flying that wind-starched banner as she scudded along on the brisk breeze was little more than seventy feet long, built for speed rather than endurance . . . or even seakeeping and stability. Her crew of sixty was small for any galley, even one as diminutive as she was, but her slender, lightly constructed hull was well suited for rowing, and her lateen sails drove her in a rapid flurry of foam as she went slicing across the brilliant sun-splintered water and foaming white horses of the thirty-mile-wide passage between Callie&#x2019;s Island and the northeastern shore of Eraystor Bay.<br>Father Rahss Sawal, the small fleet vessel&#x2019;s commander, stood on his tiny quarterdeck, hands clasped behind him, and concentrated on looking confident while he gazed up at the seabirds and wyverns hovering against the painfully blue sky. It was harder than it ought to have been to maintain the outward assurance (it would never have done to call it arrogance) proper to the master of one of Mother Church&#x2019;s couriers, and Sawal didn&#x2019;t much care for the reason he found it so.<br>The Temple&#x2019;s messengers, whether landbound or afloat, enjoyed absolute priority and freedom of passage. They carried God&#x2019;s own messages and commands, with all the authority of the archangels themselves, and no mortal had the temerity to challenge their passage wherever God or His Church might send them. That had been true literally since the Creation, and no one had ever dared to dispute it. Unfortunately, Sawal was no longer certain the centuries-old inviolability of Mother Church&#x2019;s messengers continued to hold true.<br>The thought was . . . disturbing, in more ways than one. Most immediately, because of the potential consequences for his own current mission. In the long run, because the failure of that inviolability was unthinkable. Defiance of the authority of God&#x2019;s Church could have only one consequence for the souls of the defiers, and if their example led others into the same sin . . . <br>Sawal pushed that thought aside once more, telling himself&#x2014;insisting to himself&#x2014;that whatever madness had infected the Kingdom of Charis, God would never permit it to spread beyond Charis&#x2019; borders. The universal authority of Mother Church was the linchpin not simply of the world in which he lived, but of God&#x2019;s very plan for Man&#x2019;s salvation. If that authority were challenged, if it failed, the consequences would be unthinkable. Shanwei, lost and damned mother of evil, must be licking her fangs at the very possibility in the dark, dank corner of Hell to which the Archangel Langhorne had consigned her for her sins. Even now she must be testing the bars, trying the strength of her chains, as she tasted the overweening, sinful pride of those who sought to set their own fallible judgment in place of God&#x2019;s. Langhorne himself had locked that gate behind her, with all the authority of eternity, but Man had free will. Even now, he could turn the key in that lock if he so chose, and if he did . . .<br>Damn those Charisians, he thought grimly. Don&#x2019;t they even realize what door they&#x2019;re opening? Don&#x2019;t they care? Don&#x2019;t&#x2014;<br>His jaw tightened and he forced himself to relax his shoulders and draw a deep, cleansing breath. It didn&#x2019;t help very much.<br>His instructions from Bishop Executor Thomys had been abundantly clear. Sawal was to deliver the bishop executor&#x2019;s dispatches to Bishop Executor Wyllys in Eraystor at all costs. That phrase&#x2014;&#x201c;at all costs&#x201d;&#x2014;had never before been part of Sawal&#x2019;s orders. There&#x2019;d never been any need for it, but there was now, and&#x2014;<br>&#x201c;Deck there!&#x201d; The shout came down from the crow&#x2019;s nest. &#x201c;Deck there! Three sail on the port bow!&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;Well, well,&#x201d; Commander Paitryk Hywyt, Royal Charisian Navy, murmured to himself as he peered through the spyglass. &#x201c;This should be interesting.&#x201d;<br>He lowered the glass and frowned thoughtfully. His orders were perfectly clear on this point. They&#x2019;d made him more than a little nervous when he first received them, but they were definitely clear, and now he discovered that he was actually looking forward to obeying them. Odd. He wouldn&#x2019;t have thought that was likely to happen.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a Church courier, all right,&#x201d; he said a bit louder, and Zhak Urvyn, HMS Wave&#x2019;s first lieutenant, made a distinctly unhappy sound.<br>&#x201c;Some of the men may not like it, Sir,&#x201d; Urvyn said softly. Hywyt glanced sideways at him, then shrugged.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a feeling the men&#x2019;s attitude may just surprise you a bit, Zhak,&#x201d; he said dryly. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re still about as pissed off as I&#x2019;ve ever seen them, and they know who that courier&#x2019;s really working for this morning.&#x201d; <br>Urvyn nodded, but he looked gloomier than ever, and Hywyt grimaced mentally. It wasn&#x2019;t the men Urvyn expected to be unhappy; it was Urvyn himself.<br>&#x201c;Bring her three points to port, if you please, Lieutenant,&#x201d; Hywyt said, speaking rather more formally than was his wont. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s lay out a course to intercept her.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Aye, aye, Sir.&#x201d; Urvyn&#x2019;s expression was worried, but he saluted and passed the order to the helmsman while other hands pattered across the wooden decks to tend sheets and braces.<br>Wave changed course, slicing across the water close-hauled on the port tack, and Hywyt felt a familiar surge of pleasure as his vessel responded. The sleek, flush-decked, twin-masted schooner was just over ninety-five feet long on the waterline, and mounted fourteen thirty-pounder carronades. Unlike some of her sisters, Wave had been designed and built from the keel up as a light cruiser for the Royal Charisian Navy. Her revolutionary sail plan made her faster and far more weatherly than any other ship Hywyt had ever encountered, far less commanded, and she&#x2019;d already taken no less than seven prizes&#x2014;almost half of those captured by the entire blockading squadron&#x2014;here in Emeraldian waters since the Battle of Darcos Sound. That was what speed and handiness meant, and the comfortable sound prize money made falling into their purses had helped overcome any lingering qualms his crew might have cherished. They were Charisians, after all, he thought with a gleam of humor. Charis&#x2019; numerous detractors were wont to refer to the Kingdom as a &#x201c;kingdom of shopkeepers and moneylenders,&#x201d; and not in tones of approval. Hywyt had listened to their rancorous envy for years, and he had to admit there was at least a little truth to the stereotype of the Charisian constantly on the prowl for ways to make a quick mark.<br>Of course, we&#x2019;re also very good at it, aren&#x2019;t we? he reflected, and felt himself smiling as the courier boat with the dark green flag drew rapidly nearer.<br>He couldn&#x2019;t be positive the other ship had come from Corisande, but no other explanation seemed very likely. The dispatch boat had obviously approached through Dolphin Reach, which certainly meant it had also crossed the Sea of Zebediah. No courier from Haven or Howard would have been coming from that direction, and Hywyt rather doubted Sharleyan of Chisholm was particularly interested in corresponding with Nahrmahn of Emerald at the moment. And judging from the way the fellow had chosen the strait between Callie&#x2019;s Island and the Emeraldian coast, he definitely didn&#x2019;t want to attract the attention of the blockade squadron.<br>Unfortunately for him, he already had, and it was evident that his ship, for all its sleek design, was quite a bit slower than Wave under these conditions. <br>&#x201c;Clear for action,&#x201d; he said, and watched the gap between the two ships narrow as the drum began to beat.&nbsp;Rahss Sawal tried very hard not to swear as the Charisian schooner swept towards him. Obviously, his information was even more out-of-date than he&#x2019;d feared when Bishop Executor Thomys gave him his orders. He hadn&#x2019;t expected to see Charisian warships actually inside Eraystor Bay proper. Then again, he hadn&#x2019;t expected to see the gold kraken on black of the Charisian flag flying above what used to be the Emeraldian fortress on Callie&#x2019;s Island, either.<br>The dispersal of the Charisian warships was the clearest possible evidence of the totality of their victory at the Battle of Darcos Sound. The true extent of the allied fleet&#x2019;s defeat had still been unclear when Sawal left Manchyr. That it had been crushing was obvious, but everyone in Corisande had clung to the hope that the majority of the ships which had not returned had found refuge in Emerald, where they were even then helping Nahrmahn defend their anchorage.<br>Obviously not, Sawal thought sourly.<br>He could see exactly four ships now, counting the schooner charging down on his own command, and every one of them flew Charisian colors. They were spread out widely, as well, to cover as much of the bay as they could, and they wouldn&#x2019;t have been doing that if there&#x2019;d been any possibility at all that someone might consider attacking them. That, coupled with the fact that all the island fortifications Sawal could see from his quarterdeck had clearly become Charisian bases, not Emeraldian ones, made it abundantly clear that there was no &#x201c;allied fleet&#x201d; any longer, much less one that was still defending its anchorage.<br>Sawal had never before encountered one of the Charisians&#x2019; new schooners, and he was astonished at how close to the wind the thing could sail. And by the size and power of its sail plan. His ship had the same number of masts, but the Charisian had to have at least twice the sail area. It also had the stability and size to carry more sail, and it was driving far harder under these conditions than his own ship could manage.<br>The number of gun ports arranged along its side was at least equally impressive, and he felt his stomach muscles tighten as the stubby muzzles of cannon poked out of them.<br>&#x201c;Father?&#x201d;<br>He glanced at his own second-in-command. The one-word question made the other priest&#x2019;s tension abundantly clear, and Sawal couldn&#x2019;t blame him. Not that he had an answer for what he knew the man was actually asking. <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll have to see what we see, Brother Tymythy,&#x201d; he said instead. &#x201c;Hold your course.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;He&#x2019;s not changing course,&#x201d; Urvyn said.<br>As redundant statements of the obvious went, that one took some beating, Hywyt thought.<br>&#x201c;No, he isn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; the commander agreed with massive restraint as the range fell steadily. It was down to less than three hundred yards and still dropping, and he wondered how far the other skipper was going to go in calling what he undoubtedly hoped was Wave&#x2019;s bluff. &#x201c;Pass the word to the Gunner to stand ready to fire a shot across his bow.&#x201d;<br>Urvyn hesitated. It was a tiny thing. Someone else might not have noticed it at all, but Urvyn had been Hywyt&#x2019;s first lieutenant for over six months. For a moment, Hywyt thought he would have to repeat the order, but then Urvyn turned heavily away and raised his leather speaking trumpet. <br>&#x201c;Stand ready to fire across his bow, Master Charlz!&#x201d; he shouted, and Wave&#x2019;s gunner waved back in acknowledgment.&nbsp;&#x201c;I think he&#x2019;s&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>Brother Tymythy never completed that particular observation. There was no need. The flat, concussive thud of a single gun punctuated it quite nicely, and Sawal watched the cannonball go slashing across the waves, cutting its line of white across their crests as cleanly as any kraken&#x2019;s dorsal fin. <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s fired on us!&#x201d; Tymythy said instead. His voice was shrill with outrage, and his eyes were wide, as if he was actually surprised that even Charisians should dare to offer such insult to Mother Church. And perhaps he was. Sawal, on the other hand, discovered that he truly wasn&#x2019;t.<br>&#x201c;Yes, he has,&#x201d; the under-priest agreed far more calmly than he felt.<br>I didn&#x2019;t really believe they&#x2019;d do it, he thought. I&#x2019;m sure I didn&#x2019;t. So why am I not surprised that they have? This is the beginning of the end of the world, for God&#x2019;s sake!<br>He thought again about the dispatches he carried, who they were addressed to, and why. He thought about the whispered rumors, about exactly what Prince Hektor and his allies had hoped for . . . what rewards they&#x2019;d been promised by the Church.<br>No, not by the Church, Sawal told himself. By the Knights of the Temple Lands. There is a difference!<br>Yet even as he insisted upon that to himself, he knew better. Whatever technical or legal distinctions might exist, he knew better. And that, he realized now, with something very like despair, was why he truly wasn&#x2019;t surprised. <br>Even now, he couldn&#x2019;t put it into words for himself, couldn&#x2019;t make himself face it that squarely, but he knew. Whatever might have been true before the massive onslaught Prince Hektor and his allies had launched upon the Kingdom of Charis, the Charisians knew as well as Sawal who had truly been behind it. They knew the reality of the cynical calculations, the casual readiness to destroy an entire realm in blood and fire, and the arrogance which had infused and inspired them. This time the &#x201c;Group of Four&#x201d; had come too far out of the shadows, and what they had envisioned as the simple little assassination of an inconvenient kingdom had turned into something very different.<br>Charis knew who its true enemy had been all along, and that explained exactly why that schooner was prepared to fire on the flag of God&#x2019;s own Church.<br>The schooner was closer now, leaning to the press of her towering spread of canvas, her bow garlanded with white water and flying spray that flashed like rainbow gems under the brilliant sun. He could make out individuals along her low bulwarks, pick out her uniformed captain standing aft, near the wheel, see the crew of the forward gun in her starboard broadside reloading their weapon. He looked up at his own sails, then at the schooner&#x2019;s krakenlike grace, and drew a deep breath.<br>&#x201c;Strike our colors, Brother Tymythy,&#x201d; he said.<br>&#x201c;Father?&#x201d; Brother Tymythy stared at him, as if he couldn&#x2019;t believe his own ears.<br>&#x201c;Strike our colors!&#x201d; Sawal repeated more firmly. <br>&#x201c;But, but the Bishop Executor&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Strike our colors!&#x201d; Sawal snapped. <br>For a moment, he thought Tymythy might refuse. Tymythy knew their orders as well as Sawal did, after all. But it was far easier for a bishop to order an under-priest to maintain the authority of Mother Church &#x201c;at any cost&#x201d; than it was for Father Rahss Sawal to get the crew of his vessel killed as part of an exercise in futility.<br>If there were any hope of actually delivering our dispatches, I wouldn&#x2019;t strike, he told himself, and wondered whether or not it was the truth. But it&#x2019;s obvious we can&#x2019;t keep away from them, and if those people over there are as prepared to fire into us as I think they are, they&#x2019;ll turn this entire vessel into toothpicks with a single broadside. Two, at the outside. There&#x2019;s no point in seeing my own people slaughtered for nothing, and we aren&#x2019;t even armed.<br>The flag which had never before been dipped to any mortal power fluttered down from the courier boat&#x2019;s masthead. Sawal watched it come down, and an ice-cold wind blew through the marrow of his bones.<br>It was a small thing, in so many ways, that scrap of embroidered fabric. But that was how all true catastrophes began, wasn&#x2019;t it?

Forster&#39;s &#34;A Passage to India&#34; is edited by Oliver Stallybrass, with an introduction by Pankaj Mishra. When Adela Quested and her elderly companion Mrs Moore arrive in the Indian town of Chandrapore, they quickly feel trapped by its insular and prejudiced &#39;Anglo-Indian&#39; community. Determined to escape the parochial English enclave and explore the &#39;real India&#39;, they seek the guidance of the charming and mercurial Dr Aziz, a cultivated Indian Muslim. But a mysterious incident occurs while they are exploring the Marabar caves with Aziz, and the well-respected doctor soon finds himself at the centre of a scandal that rouses violent passions among both the British and their Indian subjects. A masterly portrait of a society in the grip of imperialism, &#34;A Passage to India&#34; compellingly depicts the fate of individuals caught between the great political and cultural conflicts of the modern world. In his introduction, Pankaj Mishra outlines Forster&#39;s complex engagement with Indian society and culture. This edition reproduces the Abinger text and notes, and also includes four of Forster&#39;s essays on India, a chronology and further reading. E. M. Forster (1879-1970) was a noted English author and critic and a member of the Bloomsbury group. His first novel, &#34;Where Angels Fear To Tread&#34; appeared in 1905. &#34;The Longest Journey&#34; appeared in 1907, followed by &#34;A Room With A View&#34; (1908), based partly on the material from extended holidays in Italy with his mother. &#34;Howards End&#34; (1910) was a story that centred on an English country house and dealt with the clash between two families, one interested in art and literature, the other only in business. Maurice was revised several times during his life, and finally published posthumously in 1971.

(Anita Desai).</p><p>What really happened in the Marabar caves? This is the mystery at the heart of E.M. Forster's 1924 novel, <i>A Passage to India</i>, the puzzle that sets in motion events highlighting an even larger question: Can an Englishman and an Indian be friends? <p> "It is impossible here," an Indian character tells his friend, Dr. Aziz, early in the novel. </p><blockquote> "They come out intending to be gentlemen, and are told it will not do.... Why, I remember when Turton came out first. It was in another part of the Province. You fellows will not believe me, but I have driven with Turton in his carriage--Turton! Oh yes, we were once quite intimate. He has shown me his stamp collection. <p> "He would expect you to steal it now. Turton! But red-nosed boy will be far worse than Turton! </p><p> "I do not think so. They all become exactly the same, not worse, not better. I give any Englishman two years, be he Turton or Burton. It is only the difference of a letter. And I give any Englishwoman six months. All are exactly alike." </p></blockquote> Written while England was still firmly in control of India, Forster's novel follows the fortunes of three English newcomers to India--Miss Adela Quested, Mrs. Moore, and Cyril Fielding--and the Indian, Dr. Aziz, with whom they cross destinies. The idea of true friendship between the races was a radical one in Forster's time, and he makes it abundantly clear that it was not one that either side welcomed. If Aziz's friend, Hamidullah, believed it impossible, the British representatives of the Raj were equally discouraging. <blockquote> "Why, the kindest thing one can do to a native is to let him die," said Mrs. Callendar.<br> "How if he went to heaven?" asked Mrs. Moore, with a gentle but crooked smile.<br> "He can go where he likes as long as he doesn't come near me. They give me the creeps." </blockquote> Despite their countrymen's disapproval, Miss Quested, Mrs. Moore, and Mr. Fielding are all eager to meet Indians, and in Dr. Aziz they find a perfect companion: educated, westernized, and open-minded. Slowly, the friendships ripen, especially between Aziz and Fielding. Having created the possibility of esteem based on trust and mutual affection, Forster then subjects it to the crucible of racial hatred: during a visit to the famed Marabar caves, Miss Quested accuses Dr. Aziz of sexually assaulting her, then later recants during the frenzied trial that follows. Under such circumstances, affection proves to be a very fragile commodity indeed. <p> Arguably Forster's greatest novel, <i>A Passage to India</i> limns a troubling portrait of colonialism at its worst, and is remarkable for the complexity of its characters. Here the personal becomes the political and in the breach between Aziz and his English "friends," Forster foreshadows the eventual end of the Raj. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>8 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Brother To Brother: New Writings by Black Gay Men</h2><p>HARD TO FIND</p><p>Poet, editor, and activist <b>Essex Hemphill</b> was born April 16, 1957, in Chicago, Illinois.

The strength of the book's politics, however,pk is undermined by offerings of dubious literary merit.pk Generally, the short fiction is only adequately written, depicting young closeted men afraid to come out to their abusive parents and peers. One exception is John Keene Jr.'s "Adelphus King," a sweet tale about a man who falls head over heels for his cousin's boyfriend, a charismatic jazz musician. The poems in the collection speak routinely about sex and love; the most touching deal with the loss of loved ones to AIDS. By far, the most satisfying writing is Ron Simmons's incisive "Some thoughts on challenges facing black gay intellectuals," which exposes the homophobic views of many black writers and calls for the development of "an affirming and liberating philosophical understanding of homosexuality that will self-actualize black gay genius."

Later paperback edition of the autobiography of the boxer Jake La Motta that was made into a great film by Martin Scorsese in 1980. Most critics agree that the film was the best film of the decade, even though it lost the best picture Oscar to Ordinary People. Great performances from the entire cast. Vg+</p><p>In prose as straightforward and at times as brutal as his style in the ring, former middleweight champion Jake LaMotta wove together an unforgettable autobiography: first published in 1970, <i>Raging Bull</i> was violent, candid, primitive, smart, and altogether powerful. It still is. His story, adapted for the screen in 1980 by Martin Scorsese in the Oscar-winning film starring Robert De Niro, is filled with anger--at his father for beating him, at the neighborhood he grew up in, at the petty criminal he became, at the Mob that tried to keep him from the title because he wouldn't take a dive--and real candor about the dive he did take (out in the real world when his boxing career was over). While most of LaMotta's anger was self-directed, he harnessed enough of it to power him to 83 victories in 106 fights, and a two-year hold on a championship belt. His recounting of his ring wars with Sugar Ray Robinson and Marcel Cerdan remain as convincingly primal on the page as they were in the arena.Meet Jake La Motta: thief, rapist, killer. Raised in the Bronx slums, he fought on the streets, got sent to reform school, and served time in prison. Trusting no one, slugging everyone, he beat his wife, his best friends, even the mobsters who kept the title just out of reach. But the same forces that made him criminal - fear, rage, jealousy, self-hate, guilt - combined with his drive and intelligence to make him a winner in the ring. At age 27, after eight years of fighting, he became Middleweight Champion of the World, a hero to thousands. Then, at the peak of success, he fell apart, and began a swift, harrowing descent into nightmare. Raging Bull, the Bronx Bull&#39;s brutally candid memoir, tells it all - fights, jails, sex, money - surpassing, in hard-hitting prose, even the movie that immortalized it.</p><h2>Contract Bridge for Beginners: A Simple Concise Guide on Bidding and Play for the Novice</h2><p>Here is the first book on Contract Bridge for beginners which introduces them at once to the generally accepted <i>Point Count</i> method of bidding used by the experts. Written by the leading authority, the foremost teacher, and the most successful bridge player in the world, it will prove a boon to the novice and the average bridge player alike.</p><p>Charles H. Goren is the Number One ranking player of the United States in the official ratings of the American Contract Bridge League. He holds virtually every record of note on the books of tournament play. He has won more National Championships than anyone in history and holds the record for the most number of National Championships won in a single year (five). Incidentally, he is the only player in the history of Bridge who has ever won every major championship in the United States. Mr. Goren's daily column is syndicated in 150 newspapers which have a combined circulation of over twenty-five million. His books have been translated into French, Spanish, Swedish, and enjoy wide publication throughout the British Empire. His recent book, <i>Point Count Bidding</i>, published by Simon and Schuster, is the most successful bridge book in the last fifteen years and has changed the bidding habits of millions of players throughout the United States and Europe.The point count method introduced by Mr. Goren several years ago has now been adopted by all recognized authorities of the game.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br><b>PRELIMINARIES</b><br><br>For the purpose of this chapter I am proceeding upon the assumption that the reader is totally unfamiliar with the deck of playing cards. If in your case I have made an incorrect assumption, please do not, out of a sense of courtesy, linger over these pages. Simply skip this chapter on Preliminaries.<br><br><b>The Deck</b><br><br>Before embarking on the study of Contract Bridge one must acquaint oneself thoroughly with the values of the cards which make up the deck. The game can be played with only one deck of cards, but it is more convenient to use two separate packs. Only one pack is in use at a time, and while one is in use the other is being shuffled or mixed to be ready for the next deal. In order to avoid confusion it is better to employ decks with different colored backs.<br><br>The standard pack contains 52 cards. It is true that as you take them from the container you will find 54 cards; but two of them are Jokers, which are used in some games, but not in Bridge. So for the immediate future I suggest that you put them out to pasture.<br><br><b>The Four Suits</b><br><br>The deck is divided into four surfs: Spades (*), Hearts (*), Diamonds (*), Clubs (*). Each suit contains 13 cards: Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2. In designating a card you specify first the number and then the suit.<br><br>There are some cards which are more frequently referred to by their nicknames. The three is usually called the TREY, and the two is almost universally designated as the DEUCE.<br><br><b>Rank of the Cards</b><br><br>Each card has its rank. The rank represents the ability to capture other cards of the same suit. The highest-ranking card is the Ace, which can capture any of the other twelve cards in that suit. The King, while it is outranked by the Ace and may be captured by it, has the ability to capture eleven other cards in that suit, from the Queen on down to the Deuce. Next to the Queen comes the Jack, and after that the numbers in descending order from the 10 down through the Deuce. The five highest-ranking cards (Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10) are called HONOR CARDS. Their significance will become more apparent to you as we progress.<br><br>Assuming that you and your opponents are all playing cards of the same suit, any card which is higher in rank will capture any other card which is lower in rank. But as I indicated a moment ago, the question of rank does not come up unless you are playing cards of the same suit. Your Ace of Diamonds will capture someone else's King of Diamonds because it is higher in rank, but that same Ace of Diamonds will not capture someone else's Deuce of Clubs. To capture a Club you would need a higher-ranking Club.<br><br>In the preceding paragraphs we have been discussing the rank (capturing power) of cards where all players have played cards of the same suit. Now we come to a more complicated situation where all players are not able to play cards of the same suit. During the bidding period, which we shall take up in a subsequent chapter, one of the suits may be named by the highest bidder to be the TRUMP SUIT. When this is done, that suit becomes invested with certain trick-taking powers which the other suits do not possess. It becomes in a sense the privileged class. The special privilege of this suit is as follows: a player holding a trump card may use it to RUFF or TRUMP any card of some other suit. That means that if that player plays a card of the trump suit, he will capture the played cards of the other suits, even though they are of higher rank. The trump suit in effect has a veto power. It can veto a higher rank of some other suit. A trump card, however low in rank, will capture the highest-ranking card of any other suit. If Clubs are trump, the Deuce of Clubs will prevail over the Ace of Spades. The only cards which can beat the Deuce of Clubs (trumps) are the Clubs (trumps) of higher rank.<br><br>However, it may be pointed out at this time that players are at all times required to follow suit if they can. That is to say, if the first player plays a Spade, everyone else must play a Spade, if able to, and may not use a trump unless he has no Spades. If any player has no Spades he may trump, if he chooses, or he may throw a card of some other suit, in which case the four cards played are taken in by the one who played the highest card of the suit which was led. (These four cards constitute what is known as a TRICKS.)<br><br>The suits also have ranks. Their rank is:<br><br>Spades<br><br>Hearts<br><br>Diamonds<br><br>Clubs<br><br><b>The Game</b><br><br>Contract Bridge is divided into two major parts: (1) the bidding; (2) the play. I shall temporarily refrain from discussing the bidding until I have given you some idea of the play, which in turn will simplify the problem of bidding. The bidding takes place at the beginning, but for the reasons outlined above we shall start with the mechanics of the play of the cards.<br><br>During the bidding there is an auction to determine the right to name the final trump. The rank of the suits has an important bearing on this bidding, and we shall discuss this presently.<br><br>The active participants at the Bridge table are always four players, but they do not play individually, for two of them are pitted against the two players sitting in the opposite direction, each partner facing the other partner. The partners share in the responsibility for anything done by either member of the partnership. All gains are credited to both members of the partnership, and all losses are charged in the same manner.<br><br>Partnerships are chosen by drawing cards. A deck of cards is spread face down on the table and each player draws one card. The two players drawing the high cards become partners. They sit facing each other and play against the other two. If two cards of the same denomination are drawn, the higher is determined by the rank of the suits and for this purpose the suits rank: Spades, Hearts, Diamonds and Clubs.<br><br>The player who cuts the highest card becomes the dealer and has the choice of seats and cards. Remember, Contract Bridge should be played with two decks with different backs, and while one partner deals, his partner should shuffle the other deck for the next dealer and place the deck to his own right so that it will be readily available for the next dealer.<br><br>The dealer presents the cards to his right-hand opponent for the CUT. The cut is merely the process of lifting off a portion of the deck and placing it on the table toward the dealer, just beside the bottom portion. However, each portion must contain at least four cards. That is to say, the player making the cut must remove at least four cards or at most forty-eight. The dealer then completes the cut by placing the bottom portion on top of the portion which the cutter has removed. The dealer then deals thirteen cards to each player, one at a time in a clockwise direction, that is, to his left. Each player then picks up his thirteen cards. This distribution of the cards is known as the DEAL.<br><br>After the cards have been dealt, there is a period during which the BIDDING takes place. This bidding is known as the AUCTION. When a player makes a bid, he offers to win a certain number of tricks.<br><br>When a player makes the highest bid, he and his partner win the contract, and we may for purposes of identification refer to them as the CONTRACTING SIDE. They have just contracted to win the number of tricks specified in their final bid.<br><br>Then comes the play period. One of the contracting players is called the DECLARER. He might be considered the active partner. The other member is called the DUMMY. The declarer is always that member of the partnership who first mentioned the trump suit in which the hand is to be played (not necessarily the last bidder).<br><br>When the bidding ends, the player to the left of the declarer places one of his thirteen cards face up on the table. This is known as the OPENING LEAD, which inaugurates the play of the hand. The opening leader is not restricted in his choice. He may choose any one of his thirteen cards. And it will do no harm to repeat that all players must follow suit if they can. If these players hold more than one card in the suit led, they may choose to play on any particular trick any one of the cards held. They need not beat any card played to the trick, unless they choose to do so. If a player cannot follow suit, he may play any card in his hand without restriction. He need not trump, but he may if he so desires.<br><br>After the opening lead, the partner of the declarer spreads his thirteen cards upon the table, and this hand becomes the dummy. The declarer chooses each and every card that is to be played from dummy. He plays both his hand and the dummy hand, but the defending players play their own hands. The cards are played to each trick in the player's proper turn. No card may be played out of turn. When each player has played, there will be four cards on the table, and these are called a TRICK. Of the four cards played to the trick, one card will have winning rank and will capture that trick. The player whose card has captured the trick has the fight to lead to the next trick; and the same process is continued until all thirteen cards have been played.<br><br>Let us observe the mechanics of trick-taking with a few illustrations.<br><br>We shall assume that the bidding has been completed and play is about to begin. For purposes of identification, we shall refer to the players by directions, as though we were looking down upon the table as we would upon a map. North is the upper part of the diagram; East is to the right; South at the lower part of the picture; and West to the left. This map is as natural to a Bridge player as a beard is to Uncle Sam. For the purpose of our discussion, South will be declarer and naturally, therefore, North will be the dummy.<br><br>The first play, known as the opening lead, has been made by the player to declarer's left -- that is, West.<br><br>North and South are the contractors and are partners against East and West. Note that a card has been played by each of the four players, who have played in rotation (clockwise), starting with West. The four cards are at the moment face up on the table and are about to be picked up by East on behalf of his partnership. These four cards (a trick) belong to East and West. In other words, they have won the first trick because East played the highest card of the trick and therefore captured the others.<br><br>Play then proceeds to trick number two. Inasmuch as East won the first trick (though it goes to the partnership credit), he plays first (that is, he leads) to the next trick.<br><br>Observe that East led the 3 of Diamonds to trick two. The other three hands played in rotation in a clockwise direction. South played the Queen of Diamonds, West the Deuce of Diamonds, and North the 6 of Diamonds. The Queen of Diamonds was the highest card played to this trick and therefore captured the other three cards. The trick is therefore won by the player who played this high card, namely South. He gathers up the four cards and places the trick face down in front of him. Now at the end of the second trick each side has won a trick, and play proceeds in this manner until all the cards have been played. Consequently, there will always be exactly thirteen tricks in each hand.<br><br>It has been pointed out that the winner of each trick must lead to the next trick and that play always proceeds in a clockwise direction. A player may not put down his card until it is his turn to play. If West is the leader, East may not play until after North has played, and South must wait for East to play before he puts down his card.<br><br>It might be profitable to repeat at this time the FOLLOW-SUIT RULE, which provides as follows: Whereas the leader to each trick has his own complete choice as to which card to play, the other three players are restricted in their choice. They must follow suit if possible -- that is to say, they must play cards of the same suit as the card which the leader played. They may play high cards or low cards at their own discretion, but they must follow suit if able to do so. However, if a player has no cards of that suit, he is at liberty to play any card he chooses.<br><br>We have previously made a brief reference to the dummy (declarer's partner). After the opening lead dummy spreads his hand (13 cards), arranged in suits, face up on the board before him. Thereafter he remains silent -- dumb. Declarer indicates what card he is to play whenever it becomes dummy's turn to play. However, declarer must observe all the rules in regard to dummy's hand, just as he does with his own. The dummy must play in proper turn (though the cards are actually selected by declarer); the dummy must follow suit, if possible; and, when a trick is won in dummy, the lead to the next trick must come from dummy's hand.<br><br>Tricks can be won not only with high cards (though most tricks are won that way) but also with low cards. In the illustrations we have examined thus far all players followed suit, and the trick went to that player who played the highest card. A 7 might win a trick if all other players put down smaller cards, but it would take the Ace to win a trick if one of the other players put down a King.<br><br><b>Winning Tricks by Using Trumps (Ruffing)</b><br><br>We have not yet come to the subject of the selection of a trump suit, but it has been pointed out that one of the distinctive features of the game of Bridge is that in many hands a suit in due course becomes chosen as the trump suit and enjoys a certain superiority over the others. Every card of the trump suit is vested with a superior trick-taking power. It is known as the RUFFING power (or trumping power), which a player may exercise whenever he is unable to follow suit.<br><br>A player who has no cards of the suit which has been led may ruff, or trump, by playing any card of the trump suit. If he is the only one who has played a trump, he wins the trick regardless of the size of his trump. In other words, the Deuce of trumps will capture the Ace of some other suit, provided the player who produces the Deuce of trumps has no more of the suit which has been led.<br><br>Spades are trumps. West leads the Queen of Hearts; North attempts to capture with the King of Hearts; East beats this with the Ace of Hearts. But South, who has no Hearts, wins the trick with the Deuce of Spades, which is trump.<br><br>If more than one player uses a trump on any particular trick, the player who contributes the highest trump wins the trick. In other words, a trump can be captured by a higher-ranking trump. Observe the following illustration:<br><br>Diamonds are trumps. West leads the King of Hearts; North follows suit with the Ace of Hearts; East, who has no Hearts, trumps (ruffs) with the 6 of Diamonds, which are trump. South also has no hearts, so he may play a trump if he chooses. He does choose to play the 8 of Diamonds, a higher trump, and therefore wins the trick. South is said to have won the trick by <i>over</i>-ruffing.<br><br>When a player is unable to follow suit, he may trump or he may play a card of some other suit. If he plays a trump, he is said to have ruffed. If he plays a card of some other suit, he is said to have made a DISCARD. The discard has no trick-taking power; therefore, the rank of the discard is immaterial. Any trick that does not contain a trump is won by the hand which plays the highest card of the suit led.<br><br>Hearts are trumps. North leads the 8 of Diamonds. East and South follow suit. West has no Diamonds and also has no trumps. He discards the Ace of Spades. North's 8 of Diamonds wins the trick. It is the highest card of the suit which was first led to that trick.<br><br>When a trump is led, the...</p><h2>Promises Keep</h2><p>Being kidnapped into a bordello has a way of changing a woman&#39;s focus.

The result: the granddaddy of all American political scandals, Teapot Dome.<br><br>In <i>The Teapot Dome Scandal</i>, acclaimed author Laton McCartney tells the amazing, complex, and at times ribald story of how Big Oil handpicked Warren G. Harding, an obscure Ohio senator, to serve as our twenty-third president. Harding and his so-called &#x201c;oil cabinet&#x201d; made it possible for the oilmen to secure vast oil reserves that had been set aside for use by the U.S. Navy. In exchange, the oilmen paid off senior government officials, bribed newspaper publishers, and covered the GOP campaign debt.<br><br>When news of the scandal finally emerged, the consequences were disastrous for the nation and for the principles in the plot to bilk the taxpayers: Harding&#x2019;s administration was hamstrung; Americans&#x2019; confidence in their government plummeted; Secretary of the Interior Albert Fall was indicted, convicted, and incarcerated; and others implicated in the affair suffered similarly dire fates. Stonewalling by members of Harding&#x2019;s circle kept a lid on the story&#x2013;witnesses developed &#x201c;faulty&#x201d; memories or fled the country, and important documents went missing&#x2013;but contemporary records newly made available to McCartney reveal a shocking, revelatory picture of just how far-reaching the affair was, how high the stakes, and how powerful the conspirators. <br><br>In giving us a gimlet-eyed but endlessly entertaining portrait of the men and women who made a tempest of Teapot Dome, Laton McCartney again displays his gift for faithfully rendering history with the narrative touch of an accomplished novelist.</p><p>Laton McCartney is the author of the national bestseller <i>Friends in High Places: The Bechtel Story&#x2013;The Most Secret Corporation and How It Engineered the World</i> and <i>Across the Great Divide: Robert Stuart and the Discovery of the Oregon Trail.</i> McCartney has written extensively on business, finance, and politics for many national magazines. He and his wife, Nancy, divide their time between Wyoming and New York.In the greatest story of government scandal ever told, Warren Harding's Secretary of the Interior was "giving away oil leases like kisses at a wedding." Oil magnates of the 1920s then tapped into the public's petroleum reserves, realizing hundreds of millions of dollars in profits, all quid pro quo. Narrator William Hughes races through the details of the devilish deals like he's just finished 20 grande lattes. His caffeinated style mixed with a conspiracy as complicated as an Agatha Christie novel will leave many listeners' heads spinning--and grateful there won't be a test at the end. Hughes has a laudable knack with the numerous quotes, using subtle changes in his word stress to set them apart without employing annoying pauses or hundreds of characterizations.

Becker, MD,</b> was a pioneering researcher and leading expert in the field of biological electricity and regeneration. Twice nominated for the Nobel Prize, he was an orthopedic surgeon and a full professor at the State University of New York, Upstate Medical Center, and at Louisiana State University Medical Center in Shreveport. He was the author of <i>The Body Electric</i>.Becker explores the healing potential and adverse effects of electricity. Many alternative therapies attempt to tap the curative abilities of electromagnetism, and Becker thinks they are often effective modalities which do not have the dangerous side effects of chemotherapy, radiation, and other mainstream medical procedures. On the opposite side of the coin, he reviews the potential dangers of electromagnetic fields from such sources as common household appliances, power lines, and computers--risks exhaustively exposed in Paul Brodeur's Currents of Death ( LJ 10/1/89).

The heroine is fourteen-year-old Pella Marsh, whose mother dies just before her family flees a post-apocalyptic Brooklyn for the frontier of a recently discovered planet. Hating her ineffectual father, and troubled by a powerful attraction to a virile but dangerous loner who holds sway over the little colony, Pella sets out on a course of discovery that will have tragic and irrevocable consequences for the humans in the community and the ancient inhabitants, known only as archbuilders.<br><i>Girl in Landscape</i> is a daring exploration of the violent nature of sexual awakening, a meditation on language and perception, and an homage to the great American tradition of the Western.</p><p>Science-fiction writers attempting coming-of-age stories have seldom risked showing the stew of loneliness, anger, and angst that really characterizes adolescence. Jonathan Lethem, on the other hand, avoids the plucky sidekick syndrome and instead gives us breathtakingly realistic Pella Marsh, a girl at that awful and wonderful crux in her life just before people start calling her &#34;woman.&#34; Her broken family has just moved to a newly settled planet, with strange and passive natives and the decaying remnants of a great civilization. Something in the alien environment soon enables Pella to telepathically travel, hidden in the bodies of inconspicuous &#34;household deer,&#34; into the homes of her fellow settlers. She inevitably discovers the seamy side of humanity--loss of innocence eloquently portrayed. Don&#39;t read this book on a dark day, as there&#39;s not very much sunshine in here. The entire planet is covered with ruins: ruined towns, ruined hopes and dreams, ruined families. For a rare dose of SF realism, this is a fantastic read, full of raw (but not explicit) sexuality and the unhappy hierarchies of childhood. Forget about cheerful settlers moving in next door to helpful indigenous life forms. This is what the planetary frontiers will be. No matter how far away from Earth we may travel, we&#39;ll still be the same dirty, disappointing, beautiful monsters."One of the most original voices among younger American novelists....Jonathan Lethem's imagination [is]...marvelously fertile." --<b>Newsday </b><br><br>"Lethem is opening up blue sky for American fiction."--<b>Village Voice </b><br><br>"Complex, scary and finally moving."--<b>Atlanta Journal &amp; Constitution</b> <br><br></p><h2>The Abortion Controversy - Will a Free America Survive? Will You?</h2><p>ABORTION:<br><br> Everyone has an opinion on it for, or against.<br><br> You undoubtedly do. <br> Virtually everyone in America does. <br> The author of this book does too.<br> The U.S. Supreme Court has stated one.<br> But if God is the Author of life . . .<br><br> If He has spoken on the issue . . .<br><br> Is not His opinion the most important?<br><br> What does the Bible say?<br><br> In this thoroughly researched and documented book, the author investigates the arguments for and against abortion. He details its history. He recounts the decisions of courts and judges. But above all, he brings to the fore what God Himself has to say on the topic divine counsel so clear the issue can no longer be in doubt.<br><br> But in doing so, the author presents here the clear evidence that the abortion issue is but the leading edge of a far larger controversy soon to involve America in its greatest-ever crisis that abortion is but a catalyst for a critical emergency that will threaten our most cherished personal freedoms and even the Constitution itself.<br><br> The very survival of America, Bible prophecy clearly reveals, is soon to be threatened.<br><br> Those only will survive this overwhelming test who learn of it ahead of time and prepare.</p><p>JOHN V.

Freedom is the stuff that men and women have died for, on hundreds of battlefields and under the waves of the seven seas. Why? Because it is the gift of God!

It is both a wonderfully good read and a valued reference." &#x2015;James Lovelock, author of <em>Gaia</em> and <em>Homage to Gaia</em></strong></p><p>Today it is common knowledge that the dinosaurs were wiped out by a meteorite impact 65 million years ago that killed half of all species then living. Far less well-known is a much greater catastrophe that took place at the end of the Permian period 251 million years ago: 90 percent of life was destroyed, including saber-toothed reptiles and their rhinoceros-sized prey on land, as well as vast numbers of fish and other species in the sea.</p><p>This book documents not only what happened during this gigantic mass extinction but also the recent rekindling of the idea of catastrophism. Was the end-Permian event caused by the impact of a huge meteorite or comet, or by prolonged volcanic eruption in Siberia? The evidence has been accumulating through the 1990s and into the new millennium, and Michael Benton gives his verdict at the very end. From field camps in Greenland and Russia to the laboratory bench, <em>When Life Nearly Died</em> involves geologists, paleontologists, environmental modelers, geochemists, astronomers, and experts on biodiversity and conservation. Their working methods are vividly described and explained, and the current disputes are revealed. The implications of our understanding of crises in the past for the current biodiversity crisis are also presented in detail. 46 b/w illustrations.</p> 46 illustrations</p><p>Michael J.

The symbolism may be more moving to adults, but the theme of family and preservation will resonate with children. A young mother relates how when she was a girl in the Turtle Mountains, a wood-burning, enameled stove ("The Range Eternal" emblazoned on the front) provided the family with good soup, warmth and protection. As she looks through the stove's window, the girl sees in its flames "pictures of long ago" that conjure up a range of another kind ("I saw the range of the buffalo... the wolf range and fox range.... I saw the Range Eternal." Johnson and Francher (New York's Bravest) suffuse their breathtaking paintings with light-buffalo and deer gallop in golden clouds across the landscape; in a later painting, the steam from a pot of soup curls through the afternoon sun as the young mother longs for a "center of true warmth" like that of her childhood. When she finds a stove just like her family's in an antique shop, she brings it home and teaches her son "to enter the pictures... to see... the living range restored." Erdrich skillfully works in homely details, crafting language both musical and evocative (the girl is "tucked into the stillness" on a winter night; the stove is the "warm heart of the house"). Sumptuous paintings of the plains and cozy domestic scenes combine with graceful language to describe the rituals that keep family and community together. Ages 4-7.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.Kindergarten-Grade 4-In this evocative glimpse into the past, a narrator recalls the blue enamel stove of her childhood home in the mountains of North Dakota. Her mother cooks with one hand while feeding the fire with the other. A girl thaws herself by the stove after chores. Stones warmed in the stove keep feet cozy on winter nights; hot potatoes keep hands from freezing on winter walks to school. The stove offers more than heat. It provides light and comfort against night fears and casts shadows on the wall that turn into pictures of the plains long ago, thick with grazing buffalo. The raised lettering on the stove, The Range Eternal, provides an early writing lesson. Much is lost the year electricity comes down the road, and the enamel range is traded for an electric one. Years later, the nostalgic young woman finds The Range Eternal in an antique store and is able to bring her memories to life for her son and her husband. Dreamy illustrations in muted colors float across the pages with the texture of steam, wind, and shadows forming connections between past and present.

Enter Mr. Norrell, a fusty but ambitious scholar from the Yorkshire countryside and the first practical magician in hundreds of years. What better way to demonstrate his revival of British magic than to change the course of the Napoleonic wars? Susanna Clarke's ingenious first novel, <i>Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr. Norrell</i>, has the cleverness and lightness of touch of the Harry Potter series, but is less a fairy tale of good versus evil than a fantastic comedy of manners, complete with elaborate false footnotes, occasional period spellings, and a dense, lively mythology teeming beneath the narrative. Mr. Norrell moves to London to establish his influence in government circles, devising such powerful illusions as an 11-day blockade of French ports by English ships fabricated from rainwater. But however skillful his magic, his vanity provides an Achilles heel, and the differing ambitions of his more glamorous apprentice, Jonathan Strange, threaten to topple all that Mr. Norrell has achieved. A sparkling debut from Susanna Clarke--and it's not all fairy dust. <i>--Regina Marler</i><p>BOOK SENSE BOOK OF THE YEAR<br>A <i>PEOPLE </i>MAGAZINE "TOP TEN" BOOK<br>WINNER OF THE HUGO AWARD<br>WINNER OF THE WORLD FANTASY AWARD</p><p>"Ravishing...Combines the dark mythology of fantasy with the delicious social comedy of Jane Austen into a masterpiece of the genre that rivals Tolkien."&#x2015;<i>Time</i></p><p>At the dawn of the nineteenth century, two very different magicians emerge to change England's history.

Pastors and teachers know the power of the covenant, and they know that understanding the concept of covenant is crucial to understanding Scripture. They also know that covenant theology provides the foundation for core Christian beliefs and that covenants in their historical context hold significance even today. But to laypeople and new Christians, the eternal implications of "cutting" a covenant with God can be complicating. <br><br>God of Promise unwinds the intricacies of covenant theology, making the complex surprisingly simple and accessible to every reader. With keen understanding, careful scholarship, and insight, Michael Horton leads all believers toward a deeper understanding of crucial covenant concepts.</p><p>covoeonant (n): A binding agreement; a compact; a promise<br><br>Since biblical times covenants have been a part of everyday life. Simply put, they are promises, agreements, or contracts. But how do they translate into faith and the reading of Scripture? Are covenants merely elements of a narrative? Or do they represent something more? And what are the eternal implications of "cutting" a covenant with God?<br><br>In God of Promise, author Michael Horton unwinds the intricacies of crucial covenant concepts, showing how they provide a significant organizational structure for all of Scripture. They give us a context in which to understand the voices and message of the biblical narrative. They provide life with a goal and history with a meaning.<br><br>Whether you're a pastor, ministry leader, or professor, God of Promise will give you a new understanding of covenants and covenant theology, providing a framework for an important theological concept.<br>"Thought is packed tight in this masterful survey of the covenantal frame of God's self-disclosure in Scripture, and for serious students it is a winner."--J. I. Packer, professor of theology, Regent College<br><br>"God of Promise is a rigorous and articulate defense of a traditional view of covenant theology. Dr. Horton's federalist emphasis gleans from well-established Reformed writers while adding his own highly readable and insightful commentary."--Bryan Chapell, president, Covenant Theological Seminary<br><br>"Michael Horton has brought covenant theology to life in a way which engages modern thought and appeals to contemporary students and pastors alike. His book is a clear guide to an essential topic."--Gerald Bray, Anglican professor of divinity, Beeson Divinity School, Sanford UniversityFRONT FLAP<br><br>Covenant theology 101<br><br>"It's not just that we were created and then given a covenant," writes author Michael Horton. "We were created as covenant creatures-partners not in deity but in the drama about to unfold throughout history." <br><br>While some Bible readers quake at the mention of "covenant" or "doctrine," it is vitally important to recognize and understand the significance of covenant and its role in bridging the gap between sinner and salvation. Why? Because to understand covenant theology is to understand how it unifies the diverse teachings of Scripture, binds the Old and New Testaments as one narrative, and enriches the meaning in your relationship with the Triune God.<br><br>Whether new to Reformed theology or not, every believer needs to understand the importance of covenants. God of Promise unpacks covenant theology so you can explore the core of Christianity: knowing-and honoring-the promises of our Creator.<br><br>BACK FLAP<br><br>Michael Horton (Ph.D., University of Coventry and Wycliffe Hall, Oxford) is professor of apologetics and theology at Westminster Seminary California.

In response to this curiosity, this one-year diary not only offers an unprecedented entr�e into his private world, but offers an introduction to his essential thought. "If there is a theme to this journal," Wilber writes, "it is that body, mind, and the luminosities of the soul &#x2013; all are perfect expressions of the Radiant Spirit that alone inhabits the universe, sublime gestures of that Great Perfection that alone outshines the world." <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wilber's personal writings include: <br> details of his own spiritual practice advice to spiritual seekers reflections on his work and that of other prominent theorists in the field of integral psychology his day-to-day personal experiences dozens of his short theoretical essays on topics from art to feminism to spirituality to psychotherapy</p><p>Okay, Ken Wilber fans, you've waited long enough. The intensely private potentate of the integral path has broken his silence and published a year's worth of journal notes. Pull up a chair. You've entered the living room of one of the most intriguing spiritual theorists on the planet. He'll tell you a little about his work schedule, friendships with publishers, artists, and intellectuals, and you'll talk late into the night about bringing together the best parts of all the world's wisdom traditions. Hold on tight, though, because the conversational pace can be dizzying, bouncing from Nagarjuna to Plotinus, Derrida to Nagel, feminism to Zen, psychotherapy to vipassana. And this isn't just superficial soul-babble. Give it a while to sink in. Take a sip of wine. Move on to more expansive talk of higher states of being. Wilber will describe his own meditative experiences and how they relate to his revision of the Great Chain of Being. As daylight breaks, you'll gaze into the early twilight, wondering how you failed to notice all those hidden dimensions within and beyond an otherwise two-dimensional world. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>he leading theorist in the field of transpersonal psychology-has written extensively about meditation, psychotherapy, and the interior life.

It is basically a very fine book on painting in small format. Penney distills her art into miniature studies that make use of techniques necessary for any size watercolor. Moreover, the explications of wet-on-wet, waxing, and masking techniques and the specific treatments of varying skies, seasons, and textures of stone are nicely done. Lacking, however, is advice on marketing one's work. Nevertheless, a unique book that is useful for a broad audience.<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.Any artistic endeavor that is confined to a small format still has the potential to be visually expansive. That is the philosophy of Long Island watercolorist Penney, whose book is aimed at practitioner and novice alike. Her angle is to use landscapes, seascapes, and natural scenes in postcards and greeting cards. Each of the more than 35 projects features step-by-step color photographs as well as indications of potential problems, such as changes in the weather.

My good friend Charlotte Hughes and I have teamed up to create a series of books featuring these two characters and they've taken on a life of their own! These books are not set in the same world as my Stephanie Plum novels, but what they have in common is lovable, dysfunctional characters, villains you love to hate, and a cross-eyed way of looking at life. Jamie and Max have intense chemistry-even though they drive each other crazy. Max thinks Jamie is a magnet for trouble and Jamie thinks Max is the most annoyingly sexy, mysterious man she's ever met. She knows she should stay away from him. But boy, oh boy, do the sparks fly when they get together. Jamie is a newspaper owner from a small southern town. And in <i>Full Speed</i>, she's after the story of a lifetime. Max Holt is right in the middle of that story, and so Jamie tracks down the millionaire playboy, forcing him to take her on as partner. What follows is a story of a corrupt minister, a gang of mobsters on the loose, a hound dog called Fleas, a wise-cracking computer genius, and lots of love in the fast lane. Not to mention plenty of steamy action between Jamie and Max. </p><p>So have fun with <i>Full Speed</i>.

She had read the newspapers over breakfast that morning, digesting their angry sermons with the long-practised pensiveness which caused her eyes to narrow. Her jaw would firm slightly as her thought processes started, shifting her chin forward a fraction -- a signal to her staff to think one more hard thought before they opened their mouths. Then, soon after nine o'clock, the phone calls from London started. </p><p> Diana had died the previous Sunday -- the last day of August 1997 -- and it had been pressure and decisions ever since. Helping the two boys had been their grandmother's first priority, applying her own therapy in times of trouble -- lots of exercise and fresh air. </p><p> "We must get them out and away from the television," said the queen as she clicked across the mournful images of the princess being run non-stop on every channel. "Let's get them both up in the hills." </p><p> The fact that they were all together as a family, away from everything, in the rugged beauty and peace of Scotland, had seemed such a blessing at first. Peter Phillips, Princess Anne's bluff and burly rugby-playing son, had gone out with William and Harry on the moors each day, jollying them along with stalking and the odd fishing expedition -- plus lots of mucking around on the brothers' noisy all-terrain motorbikes. The two young princes both loved the outdoors. In that respect they were very much Charles's sons. </p><p> The weather had been balmy, with just a hint of autumn crispness, and the whole family had driven out most evenings in the Land Rovers to eat. Ever practical, ever-tinkering, Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, is the proud deviser of a bulky, wheeled contraption that is the centre of these cherished rituals -- a picnic trailer. With the grilling rack and pots and pans stowed neat and ship-shape enough for the naval officer he had been, and padded drawers for carefully segregated types of fortifying alcohol, the wagon is towed to the shooting lodge selected for the family barbecue. No staff are present and the royal paterfamilias becomes chef. </p><p> In that first week of September, the duke's barbecue wagon had come into its own as never before. Cooking and carving and cleaning up afterwards, the shared chores and rituals of the self-help meal had kept the whole family busy and had helped create the feeling there was something everyone could do. It was practical therapy. </p><p> At fifteen, William had seemed to take it bravely, on the outside at least. But he was insisting that he would not walk behind the coffin at the funeral. Not quite thirteen, Harry had been more obviously upset. Was everyone quite sure Mummy was dead? he was heard to enquire. Could it not be checked to make sure there had not been a mistake? </p><p> Gently helping the brothers to cope was, like everything royal, more than just a private, family matter. If the two young princes did walk through the streets in London on Saturday, their composure would be the pivot on which the whole occasion turned. </p><p> Working out the details of the funeral had been the other big job since Sunday -- the style of the service, the length of the route, as well as the role that William and Harry would play. There had been family arguments in the small hours as the bad news came through. The Spencers -- Diana's mother, brother, and two sisters -- had wanted a private funeral, a small family affair, and to start with the queen herself had agreed. But by Sunday evening it was clear it would have to be a full-scale ceremony in Westminster Abbey, and since Monday the fax machine had been processing hymn sheets and processional time-tabling non-stop. Princess Margaret disapproved, but the queen mother had got quite excited about the prospect of listening to Elton John. </p><p> Then came all the fuss about the flag. </p><p> Downing Street was the first to sense that something was awry. Sitting in his media command room at No. 10, Alastair Campbell, the prime minister's press spokesman, caught a cable television news bulletin that worried him. It was Wednesday morning, and the long lines of mourners waiting in the Mall to sign the condolence books for the princess were spending as many as five hours looking through the trees towards Buckingham Palace. </p><p> People were not just signing their names when they got to the head of the queue. Most wanted to pen some special tribute of their own, and after half a day on their feet everyone wanted to sit down. </p><p> "In retrospect," says an official of the Lord Chamberlain's Office, "it was clearly a mistake to have supplied chairs." </p><p> Some people were spending as much as half an hour over the page composing their essays. So the lines waiting outside in the Mall grew longer, and as people shuffled slowly forward, they had been struck by the absence of any flag flying at half-mast over the queen's principal residence. </p><p> It was a technical matter. The queen's presence is signalled wherever she may be -- in palace, car, boat, or plane -- by the Royal Standard, a luscious and ancient confection of heraldic lions and symbolic harpstrings that follows her everywhere, battle-standard-style, and is never lowered, even when the sovereign dies. "The King is Dead, Long Live the King." </p><p> But the tradition had developed at Buckingham Palace -- though not at any other royal residence -- that, in the absence of the Royal Standard, no other flag should fly. So while flags all round the country -- including those over Windsor Castle and over the royal country residence of Sandringham in East Anglia -- were now flying at half-mast, Buckingham Palace itself was conspicuously bare of any sign of mourning for Diana. </p><p> "I've just been watching Sky News," said Campbell in a phone call to Robert Fellowes, the queen's private secretary, who was also Diana's brother-in-law, married to her elder sister, Jane. "Now, it's just a straw in the wind, but I think they're going to make some mischief over this thing of the flag." </p><p> Rupert Murdoch's Sky News had been running dramatic vox pop interviews from the Mall in which mourners complained about the bare flagpole over the palace. It made for compulsive, angry television, and Campbell guessed it was only a matter of time before the other bulletins followed suit. </p><p> "I hear what you're saying," replied Fellowes. "But it's a curious business, the flag at Buckingham Palace. There are certain things, you know, that I can deliver straight away. But I'm not sure it's going to be as easy as it looks, even if it's right, to please the public on this one." </p><p> Fellowes rang Balmoral to pass on Downing Street's concerns to his deputy Sir Robin Janvrin, who was running the private secretary's office there, and also to the queen. But the private secretary did not argue Campbell's case very strongly. </p><p> "The alarm bells," as one participant put it, "did not jangle." </p><p> Sir Robert Fellowes, today Baron Fellowes of Shotesham in the county of Norfolk, was a royal retainer who was the son of a royal retainer. His father, the bluff Sir Billy Fellowes, had run the royal estate at Sandringham and had been a shooting companion of the queen's father, King George VI. In his time as private secretary, Fellowes had overseen some important changes in the monarchy, and there was a mildly subversive twinkle behind his horn-rimmed spectacles. </p><p> "We don't have protocol here," he liked to say when talking of palace etiquette " -- just bloody good manners." </p><p> But Fellowes had breathed tradition all his life. It was a key element in his job as private secretary, and protocol had always provided a sure fall-back in times of difficulty. </p><p> Elizabeth II felt the same only more so. For the queen, tradition and protocol represented something greater than oneself -- deep values approaching the sacred. It could be compared to how non-royal people feel at their children's Christmas carol concert or when the bugle sounds on Remembrance Day -- the tingle of nobler things. It is easy to smile condescendingly at the scarlet-tunicked and bearskin-clad Guards parading formally outside Buckingham Palace until, in the aftermath of a terrorist attack on New York, these very British soldiers stand to attention while their band plays "The Star Spangled Banner." </p><p> Tradition is one of the cornerstones of the royal mystery. The most troublesome time in the otherwise tranquil childhood of the young Princess Elizabeth had been when she was just ten, when her sparky and original Uncle David had ascended to the throne as Edward VIII. Shrugging his shoulders at precedent, he had spent a hectic year insouciantly overturning tradition in his quest to make the monarchy modern, and it had ended in tears. The abdication crisis of 1936 was the darkest moment in her family's recent history. </p><p> If Prince Charles, and not his ex-wife, had died in a car crash the previous Sunday, the queen would not now be flying the Union Jack at half-mast over Buckingham Palace. She had not done it for her beloved father, George VI -- and it would not happen for the queen mother, who, despite all her personal popularity, had always understood how the institution of monarchy ultimately transcended the individual. </p><p> A personally modest spirit, the queen would certainly not expect such a gesture for herself. So why should tradition be overturned for a young woman who, Uncle David-like, had put herself before the family and had come to be the focus of such bitter and divisive trouble? </p><p> Elizabeth II had been one of the first in the family to fall out of love with Diana. </p><p> "The Queen is a very good judge of character," says one of her staff. "She was very quick in 'sussing' the less fortunate sides of the princess's personality." </p><p> The queen had tried to be fair to her daughter-in-law, taking her side on occasions in the bitter separation battle with Charles. But Diana's open sniping at what she had publicly derided as the stuffy palace establishment made her the last person for whom the queen -- or still less ...</p></p><h2>Transit</h2><p>In the wake of her family&#39;s collapse, a writer and her two young sons move to London.

Her enemies' schemes come to fruition quickly and she is banished behind the wall of the Forbidding, the anti-demon security feature that collapsed so spectacularly in the magnificent <i>Elfstones of Shannara</i>. Her fate falls in the lap of the youngest Ohmsford, Penderrin, who unlike his Aunt Grianne and his parents is without the gift of magic.

Here, in his memoir of life under the Khmer Rouge, is a searing account of a country&#39;s descent into hell.</p><p>Haing Ngor survived labour camp, torture and near death, before his escape to America. A champion for the cause of Cambodian refugees, he was murdered by street robbers in LA in 1996. Roger Warner, his friend and co-writer, writes extensively on foreign affairs.For his role as the journalist Dith Pran in the film The Killing Fields (1984), Haing Ngor, a Cambodian doctor with no acting experience, won an OscarR. In playing the part, he drew on his own tormented life as a war slave during the Cambodian civil war, which makes the agony seen in the film seem mild. Funded and fueled by Chinese Communists, the Cambodian Khmer Rouge were a gang of brutal thugs who dispossessed, robbed, raped, tortured, and murdered so many of their countrymen/women that somewhere between a third and a half of the population was decimated. Ngor himself was tortured three times and lost a finger for calling his wife "sweet." Before each of the three tortures, the listener is warned that it will be violent, but this highly compelling account has few equals among stories of cruel, sadistic oppression masquerading as ideology and should be heard in full by anyone who cares about freedom. Unlike most programs written with a collaborator, the narrative voice here is distinct and wholly convincing, and British actor Crawford Logan's authoritative reading is terrifyingly real. This is a very demanding program, but it is of such high merit and rare importance that it deserves a place in every collection.

The four years he spent as a soldier were among the most significant in his life and inspired the tales collected here. In ?The Cossacks,? Tolstoy tells the story of Olenin, a cultured Russian whose experiences among the Cossack warriors of Central Asia leave him searching for a more authentic life. ?The Sevastopol Sketches? bring into stark relief the realities of military life during the Crimean War. And ?Hadji Murat? paints a portrait of a great leader torn apart by divided loyalties. In writing about individuals and societies in conflict, Tolstoy has penned some of the most brilliant stories about the nature of war.<br><br></p><p>"Tolstoy's lavish and always graphic use of detail," wrote John Bayley, "together of course with its romance and exotic setting . . . has made "The Cossacks the most popular of all his works." This vibrant new translation of Tolstoy's 1862 novel, by PEN Translation Award winner Peter Constantine, is the author's semiautobiographical depiction of young Olenin, a wealthy, disaffected Muscovite, who joins the Russian army and travels to the untamed frontier of the Caucasus in search of a more authentic life. Quartered with his regiment in a Cossack village, Olenin revels in the glories of nature and the rough strength of the Cossacks and Chechens. Smitten by his unrequited love for a local girl, Maryanka, Olenin has a profound but ultimately short-lived spiritual awakening. Try as he might to assimilate, he remains an awkward outsider and his long search for a more enlightened and purposeful existence comes to naught.<br>With the philosophical insight that would characterize Tolstoy's later masterpieces, this long overdue major new translation is a revelation. <p>"From the Hardcover edition.</p>This novel of love, adventure, and male rivalry on the frontiers of nineteenth-century Russia -- completed in 1862, when Tolstoy was in his early thirties -- has always surprised readers who know Tolstoy best through the vast, panoramic fictions of his middle years. Unlike those works, The Cossacks is lean and supple, economical in design and execution.</p><h2>The Conqueror Worms</h2><p>As the never-ending rain causes floodwaters to rise, engulfing coastal cities and towns, a new threat from below emerges, devouring everything in its path and placing humankind on the brink of extinction. Original.</p><p>Just in time for picnic season, Keene delivers this wild, gruesome page-turner about two elderly West Virginia good old boys menaced by giant earthworms&#x2014;and worse. Octogenarian Teddy Garnett tells this story of a global flood that has left humanity in tatters. Holed up in his mountain home, Teddy and his buddy Carl Seaton struggle through daily life, puzzling over things even stranger than a 40-day rainstorm, including the giant slime-coated holes that keep showing up in Teddy's yard. Before long, Teddy and Carl are fending off man-eating earthworms the size of buses. A helicopter crash nearby brings Kevin and Sarah, the last two survivors of an outpost in Baltimore, into Teddy's story; their tale makes up the even more bizarre second part of the book that explores, graphically, the insanity doom can inspire. It all leads to a slam-bang showdown back at Teddy's house with a creature so monstrous it scares even the killer annelids. The awkward framing story&#x2014;a crushed, dying Teddy writing the novel in a notebook in the tale's aftermath&#x2014;though a nod to H.P. Lovecraft and H.G. Wells (both obvious influences), can detract from the plot's urgency. Clunky dialogue also slows the action, but the enormity of Keene's pulp horror imagination, and his success in bringing the reader over the top with him, is both rare and wonderful, and more than outweighs these small concerns. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Scott Fitzgerald</strong><br><br>Evalina Toussaint, orphaned child of an exotic dancer in New Orleans, is just thirteen when she is admitted to Highland Hospital in Asheville, North Carolina. The year is 1936, and the mental hospital is under the direction of the celebrated psychiatrist Dr. Robert S. Carroll, whose innovative treatment for nervous disorders and addictions is based upon fresh air, diet, exercise, gardening, art, dance, music, theater, and therapies of the day such as rest cures, freeze wraps, and insulin shock. Talented Evalina is soon taken under the wing of the doctor&#x2019;s wife, a famous concert pianist, and eventually becomes the accompanist for all musical programs at the hospital, including the many dances and theatricals choreographed by longtime patient Zelda Fitzgerald. <br><br>Evalina&#x2019;s role gives her privileged access to the lives and secrets of other patients and staff swept into a cascading series of events leading up to the tragic fire of 1948 that killed nine women in a locked ward on the top floor. She offers a solution for the still-unsolved mystery of that fire, as well as her own ideas about the very thin line between sanity and insanity; her opinion of the psychiatric treatment of women and girls who failed to fit into prevailing male ideals; and her insights into the resonance between art and madness. A writer at the height of her craft, Lee Smith has created, through her masterful melding of fiction and fact, a mesmerizing novel about a world apart&#x2014;a time and a place where creativity and passion, theory and medicine, fact and fiction, tragedy and transformation, are luminously intertwined.</p><p>Born in the small coal-mining town of Grundy, Virginia, <b>Lee Smith </b>began writing stories at the age of nine and selling them for a nickel apiece.

In Booth&#x2019;s world a bare lightbulb dangles precariously . . . a frayed carpet barely covers the living room floor . . . flies buzz . . . a couple speaks matter-of-factly . . . a man looks up from behind his newspaper. And somewhere, in the foreground or off to the side, a dog twitches involuntarily. In Booth&#x2019;s cartoons dogs act as a Greek chorus, serving as a proxy for the reader by pointing out the mundane absurdity of life that is obviously lost on their owners. This 40th-anniversary collection highlights George Booth&#x2019;s best and funniest dog cartoons with a special introduction by Bill Cosby.</p><p><b>Geo</b>rg<b>e Boo</b>th is an award-winning illustrator whose work has appeared in the <i>New Yorker, </i>the <i>New York Times, </i>and several children&#x2019;s books.

In 1993 Booth was recognized with a Gag Cartoon Award for his work in the <i>New Yorker </i>by the National Cartoonist Society. He lives in Stony Brook, NY.&nbsp; <b>Bill Cosby </b>is an American comedian, actor, author, producer, and activist. He is also the bestselling author of <i>Fatherhood</i>.They look like pointy-eared dwarf alligators on short, claw-footed stilts, and they&#x2019;re seldom the point or the executor of the gag, but for cartoon lovers, Booth&#x2019;s dogs are as definitive of their cartoon species as B. Kliban&#x2019;s ebullient, meatloafish cats are of theirs (there are cats in Booth&#x2019;s stuff, too, but they&#x2019;re definitely second bananas). Their memorability has a lot to do with their utter doggyness. Only occasionally, as in the formal but irregular series one might call the Sleeper and His Dog, does a Booth pooch go human by, say, turning a key in a lock. Usually, they just sit, lie, bark, scratch, and react to what a cartoon&#x2019;s unkempt, lunatic humans do and say. But, graced with an ineffably radiant tinge of the seediness that suffuses every Booth cartoon, they somehow subtly occupy a&#x2014;if not the&#x2014;spot on which the gazing eye must eventually rest. And they&#x2019;re always funny, often enough so to turn a chuckle into a chortle, maybe even a guffaw, or, better yet, a bark.</p><h2>The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge</h2><p><p><strong>Malte Laurids Brigge is a young Danish nobleman and poet living in Paris. Obsessed with death and the reality that lurks behind appearances, Brigge muses on his family's history and on the teeming alien life of the city. First published in 1910, Rilke's masterpiece has proven to be one of the most influential and enduring works of fiction of our century.</strong></p><em>The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge</em> is Rilke&#x2019;s major prose work and was one of the earliest publications to introduce him to American readers. The very wide audience which Rilke&#x2019;s work commands today will welcome the reissue in paperback of this extremely perceptive translation of the <em>Notebooks</em> by M. D. Herter Norton. A masterly translation of one of the first great modernist novels by one of the German language's greatest poets, in which a young man named Malte Laurids Brigge lives in a cheap room in Paris while his belongings rot in storage. Every person he sees seems to carry their death within them and with little but a library card to distinguish him from the city's untouchables, he thinks of the deaths, and ghosts, of his aristocratic family, of which he is the sole living descendant. Suffused with passages of lyrical brilliance, Rilke's semi-autobiographical novel is a moving and powerful coming-of-age story.</p><p>This is the definitive, widely acclaimed translation of the major prose work of one of our century's greatest poets -- "a masterpiece like no other" (Elizabeth Hardwick) -- Rilke's only novel, extraordinary for its structural uniqueness and purity of language. First published in 1910, it has proven to be one of the most influential and enduring works of fiction of our century.<br><br>Malte Laurids Brigge is a young Danish nobleman and poet living in Paris. Obsessed with death and with the reality that lurks behind appearances, Brigge muses on his family and their history and on the teeming, alien life of the city. Many of the themes and images that occur in Rilke's poetry can also be found in the novel, prefiguring the modernist movement in its self-awareness and imagistic immediacy.It is a book of quiet, close-knit prose studded with unforgettable scenes, set forth here in precise, analytical descriptions, there in intense, lyrical flights of near- poetry. It is uniquely Rilke and touches the reader with the same sudden revelations and uncanny awareness as do his poems.</p><h2>11 : 11: Inside the Doorway</h2><p>This book is about a journey - the most important and exciting journey we shall ever take. It is our journey home... 11:11 is our wake-up call. It is our map for the next twenty years. The 11:11 is our bridge to ascension. It is our doorway Home...</p><p>For many years, the numbers 11:11 have been mysteriously and repeatedly appearing to people all over the world. Often appearing on digital clocks, the sightings of 11:11 tend to occur during times of heightened awareness, having a powerful effect on those involved. They cause a reactivation of our cellular memory banks and a stirring deep inside of something long forgotten. The appearance of 11:11 is also a powerful confirmation that we are on the right track, aligned with the beam of our Highest Truth. <p>The 11:11 is an insertion point for the Greater Reality to enter the present moment. </p><p>On January 11, 1992 well over 100,000 people gathered together in groups large and small throughout the planet to activate the Doorway of the 11:11. This activation was significant because it was achieved without media publicity, spreading from heart to heart and by word of mouth. The groups came together as One Being and performed a series of Sacred Dances and Unified Movements at pre-arranged times. </p><p>The purpose of this activation was to open the Doorway of the 11:11. This doorway is the transition zone or bridge between two very different spirals of evolution, those of duality and Oneness. During the 11:11 ceremony, these two evolutionary spirals interlocked. This Zone of Overlap is the actual Doorway of the 11:11 which remains in position until the 11:11 closes on December 31, 2011 and the two spirals go their separate ways. Thus we have a twenty year period in which to step free from a duality-based reality system and make our ascension into Oneness. </p><p>This activation of the 11:11 is one of the greatest events that has ever taken place on this planet and affects us on every level of our being. Most importantly, it is very much still in effect today. There are Eleven Gates within the 11:11. Each Gate represents a new frequency band of energy. Every few years, a new 11:11 Gate is activated. The timetable of the Gates so far: January 11, 1992: the First Gate whose keynote is the Healing of our Hearts and the development of our new emotional body called the One Heart. </p><p>June 5, 1993: the activation of the Second Gate whose keynote is: And the Two Shall Become One. This is the unifying of all polarities including Earth &amp; Star, the spiritual and the physical. </p><p>There were three activations of Third Gate in 1997 whose keynote was our Expansion into One Being. And the Fourth Gate was activated in 1999 with the keynote of Reconfiguring our Evolutionary Labyrinth. All of these 11:11 Activations are achieved through a series of 11:11 Sacred Dances which are unquestionably powerful and real . The 11:11 gives us a glorious opportunity to bring forth our inherent greatness and be who we really are. </p><p>The journey through the 11:11 has become my life's work. It is far greater than any of us yet realize and it is something that we have long waited for and yearned for. The time is now. This is an accelerated journey into the unexplored realms of the Greater Reality.</p>Solara is one of the foremost visionaries of our time who is widely respected for her integrity, courage and dedication. She is the key facilitator and visionary of the 11:11, a vast transformation doorway between duality and Oneness which is in effect between 1992 and 2011. <p>Solara travels widely throughout the world giving talks, workshops and planetary activations. She is currently working on the screenplays for "The Legend of Altazar" and "EL*AN*RA: The Healing of Orion".</p></p><h2>A Slow Fire Burning: The scorching new thriller from the author of The Girl on the Train</h2><p>The unmissable new thriller from the author of the global bestsellers THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN and INTO THE WATER.<br><br><b><i>Praise for Paula Hawkins' novels:</i></b><br><br>'Really great suspense novel.

Some of the most priceless constitutional gems are found in these pages. Dr. Coleman has done 26 years of research to find them, putting together a highly-readable book which provides insight into the articles and amendments to the Constitution. It shows their true intent and purpose in sharp relief, and what it is that makes this document so great and lasting.

A guy with attitude, one who could toss out schoolyard taunts and make them sound deadly.</p><p>&#x201c;I gave you an order.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And I told you to go to hell.&#x201d;</p><p>Ali moved in then, grabbing his arm and setting up for the hip toss. Only it didn&#x2019;t work the way it was supposed to. Jose spun out of the way and suddenly Ali was the one flying through the air. She landed hard on the gym mat and with him right on top of her. The blow knocked the wind out of her and left her seeing stars. By the time Ali got her breath back, she was face down on the floor, with her wrists at her back, imprisoned in her own handcuffs. Lying there under Jose&#x2019;s full weight, she felt a rage of impotent fury flood through her. She was still there, helpless but furious, when a pair of highly polished shoes appeared in her line of vision.</p><p>&#x201c;My, my, little lady,&#x201d; Sergeant Bill Pettit said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe that&#x2019;s the way takedowns are supposed to work. He&#x2019;s the one who&#x2019;s supposed to be wearing <i>your</i> handcuffs.&#x201d;</p><p>Ali Reynolds was in week four of a six-week-long course at the Arizona Police Academy. Of all the instructors there, Pettit was her hands-down least favorite. The class had started out on the fourth of August with an enrollment of one hundred seven recruits, five of whom had been women. Now they were down to a total of seventy-nine. Two of the original females had dropped out.</p><p>&#x201c;Uncuff her,&#x201d; Pettit told Jose. &#x201c;Good job.&#x201d;</p><p>The restraints came off. Jose tossed them to her, then he grabbed Ali by the elbow and helped her up.</p><p>&#x201c;No hard feelings, Oma,&#x201d; he said with a sly Cheshire grin that said he was lying. He had done it with malice and had hit her far harder than necessary, to prove a point and because he could.</p><p>To begin with, Ali&#x2019;s fellow classmates had called her &#x201c;Oma&#x201d; behind her back. Originally the word came from one of the other young recruits, a blond-haired, ruddy-faced guy whose family hailed from South Africa. In Afrikaans <i>oma</i> evidently meant something like &#x201c;old woman&#x201d; or maybe even &#x201c;grandma.&#x201d; There it probably had an air of respect about it. Here in the academy, however, most of Ali&#x2019;s classmates were fifteen to twenty years younger than she was. In context, the word was intended as an insult, meant to keep Ali in her place. To her knowledge, this was the first time she had been called that in front of one of the instructors.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s why female officers end up having to resort to weapons so often,&#x201d; Pettit said. &#x201c;They don&#x2019;t know how to use their bodies properly. By the way, what&#x2019;s that he called you?&#x201d;</p><p>Ali&#x2019;s face flushed. &#x201c;Old Lady,&#x201d; she answered.</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Old Lady, sir!&#x201d; she corrected.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s better. Now get your butt over to first aid. You should probably have a Band-Aid on that cut over your eye. And have them give you an ice pack. Looks to me like you&#x2019;re gonna have yourself a real shiner.&#x201d;</p><p>It was a long walk through the sweaty, overheated gym. The Phoenix metropolitan area was roasting in triple-digit heat. Although the gym&#x2019;s AC was running at full strength, it couldn&#x2019;t do more than thirty degrees below the outside temp of 116.</p><p>Ali&#x2019;s classmates stopped what they were doing and stood on their own mats to watch her walk of shame. Some of them were sympathetic, but more shared Jose&#x2019;s opinion that no self-respecting fortysomething female had any business being there, and they wanted her to quit. Blood dribbled down the side of her cheek and onto the neck of her T-shirt. She made no effort to wipe it away. If her classmates were looking for blood, she&#x2019;d give it to them.</p><p>She stepped out of the gym into glaring sunshine and brutal afternoon heat. The mountains in the distance were obscured by a haze of earth-brown smog. August was supposed to be the rainy season with monsoon rains drenching the thirsty Sonoran Desert, but so far the much-needed rains were absent although the rising humidity was not.</p><p>By the time Ali arrived at the administration office, she had made herself a promise: sometime in the next two weeks, Jose Reyes was looking at a takedown of his own.</p><p>BettyJo Hamilton, the academy&#x2019;s office manager, was also in charge of first aid. &#x201c;Oh, my,&#x201d; she said, peering at Ali over a pair of horn-rimmed spectacles. &#x201c;What do we have here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just a little bump,&#x201d; Ali said.</p><p>After determining that no stitches were required, BettyJo applied a butterfly Band-Aid to the cut and then brought out an ice pack. &#x201c;If I were you,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d take it pretty easy for the rest of the afternoon. Let me know if you feel faint or experience any nausea.&#x201d;</p><p>Ali was glad to comply. She wasn&#x2019;t used to losing, and she didn&#x2019;t need to go back to the gym to revisit her ignominious defeat. Instead, she returned to the dorm, shut herself in her room, and lay down on the bed, with the ice pack over her eye.</p><p>Most of the academy attendees from the Phoenix area made the nightly trip home. The out-of-towners, recruits who lived too far away for a daily commute, made use of the dorm facilities. The three remaining women had rooms to themselves. Ali was especially grateful for that now. She needed some privacy to lick her wounds.</p><p>Months earlier Ali had been serving as an interim media relations consultant for the Yavapai County Sheriff&#x2019;s Department when Sheriff Gordon Maxwell had broached the idea of sending her to the academy. Once a well-known TV news anchor in L.A., Ali had returned to her hometown of Sedona, Arizona, after both her career and marriage came to sudden ends. Paul Grayson, Ali&#x2019;s philandering, late, and very much unlamented second husband, had been murdered the day before their divorce would have been final. As a divorc�e, Ali would have been in somewhat straitened financial circumstances. As Paul&#x2019;s widow, however, and through no fault of her own, she was now an extremely wealthy former anchor and aspiring cop.</p><p>After her life-changing pair of crises, Ali had spent a year or two back in her hometown, getting used to the idea of being on her own. Her parents, Bob and Edie Larson, owners of the Sugarloaf Caf�, lived there in Sedona, as did Ali&#x2019;s son, Christopher, and his fairly new and now newly pregnant bride, Athena, both of whom taught at Sedona High School.</p><p>For a while it was okay to be Bob and Edie&#x2019;s daughter and Chris&#x2019;s mom, but Ali was used to working, used to being busy. Finding herself bored to distraction, she took on the project of purchasing and remodeling the house on Manzanita Hills Road, which she shared with Leland Brooks. Mr. Brooks was her aging but entirely capable personal assistant or, as she liked to call him, her majordomo, since both he and the word seemed to hail from a more gracious, bygone era. Ali had had a boyfriend, but at her age the word <i>boyfriend</i> rankled. She liked to think of B. Simpson as her &#x201c;lover.&#x201d; When speaking to others, she referred to him as her &#x201c;significant other.&#x201d;</p><p>Ali was lying on the bed, wondering what B. would think about her showing up for Labor Day weekend with a shiner, when her cell phone rang. She checked the caller ID.</p><p>&#x201c;Hi, Mom,&#x201d; Ali said to her mother, Edie Larson. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s up?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;One of your friends dropped by the Sugarloaf this afternoon, looking for you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Really,&#x201d; Ali said. &#x201c;Who was it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Dad said her name was Brenda Riley. She used to work with you in L.A.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not exactly worked with,&#x201d; Ali replied. &#x201c;She was the anchor for a sister station in Sacramento when I was in L.A. So we were acquaintances and colleagues rather than friends. She got booted off the air about the same time I did for approximately the same reason. They thought she was too old. I haven&#x2019;t heard from her in years. What did she want?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She told Dad that she really needed to see you&#x2014;that it was urgent. You know your father. He&#x2019;s such a softie, he falls for every sob story on the planet.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What kind of sob story?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just that she needed to see you&#x2014;that she was looking for help. From what he said, I wouldn&#x2019;t be surprised if she was really looking for money.&#x201d;</p><p>Ali had found that old acquaintances did have a way of doing that, of showing up on her doorstep and asking for a loan or an outright handout. They seemed to think that since she had money and they didn&#x2019;t, she was obligated to give them some of hers.</p><p>&#x201c;Did Dad give her my number?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I chewed him out for it, but yes, he did. Worse than that, he also told her where you were and what you were doing. He said she seemed shocked that you were in the process of becoming a police officer.&#x201d;</p><p>Ali ran a finger over her rapidly swelling eye. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m shocked by that myself sometimes,&#x201d; she said with a laugh.</p><p>&#x201c;Anyway,&#x201d; Edie Larson continued. &#x201c;From what he said, she may very well be on her way down to Phoenix to see you right now.&#x201d;</p><p>Ali suppressed a groan. Brenda Riley was pretty much the last person she needed to see right now&#x2014;especially with a cut on her eyebrow and with a black eye coming on. Brenda had been one of those irksome women who never went anywhere without being perfectly put together&#x2014;hair, makeup, and clothing. She had been almost as tall as Ali&#x2014;five ten or so&#x2014;but as far as Ali was concerned, Brenda was better-looking in every way.</p><p>&#x201c;...</p></p><h2>Final Fantasy XII (Limited Edition): The Complete Guide</h2><p>Shipped from UK, please allow 10 to 21 business days for arrival.

Though light in tone and geared toward pre-reader eyes and interests, the mostly outdoor scenes Muth depicts command serious attention from all. The first page simultaneously demonstrates both Muth&#x2019;s adherence to haiku&#x2019;s three-line form rather than its traditional five-seven-five syllabic sequence and his exquisite use of white space. &#x201c;Autumn, / are you dreaming / of new clothes?&#x201d; reads the text as Koo reaches up to try to catch a handful of falling leaves. One of the few scenes referencing indoor living hilariously comes in early spring: &#x201c;too much TV this winter / my eyes are square / let&#x2019;s go Out and play.&#x201d; Two children and Koo stand in front of a large television, the whites of the children&#x2019;s eyes boxed and zombielike and Koo&#x2019;s, two solid black squares. A more reflective, deeply moving spring moment finds the children alone with a book in the woods, Muth&#x2019;s delicate watercolor and subtle inking deftly suggesting the forest&#x2019;s shifting scope.</p>Throughout, condensed poetic image coupled with spare illustration yields huge effect; in a word, magical.</p><h2>Crewe Train</h2><p>When Denham Dobie&#39;s father suddenly dies, she moves to London and becomes caught up in the busy social life of her relatives</p><p>On the death of her father, a retired clergyman, Denham Dobie is forced to leave her wild and carefree life in Spain and is thrust into the gossiping highbrow circle of her well-meaning relatives in London. Thrown into a world of publishers and writers, this awkward young woman &#x2039; a tomboy and rebel at heart &#x2039; sees their society for the self-absorbed, self-satisfied world it is and offers a devastating, and very funny, social commentary within her own moving story. A bitingly funny, elegantly written comedy of manners from the incomparable Rose Macaulay.Rose Macaulay (1881-1958) was born in Rugby, Warwickshire. She studied Modern History at Somerville College, Oxford and wrote her first novel, <i>Abbots Verney </i>in 1906. She was introduced to the London literary scene by her childhood friend Rupert Brooke, and her friends included Ivy Compton-Burnett, Virginia Woolf, E. M. Forster, Rosamond Lehmann and Elizabeth Bowen. Macaulay became celebrated writer who published over thirty works of fiction, non-fiction and poetry in her lifetime, including <i>Crewe Train </i>and <i>The World My Wilderness</i>. She won the James Tait Black Memorial prize for her final novel, <i>The Towers of Trebizond</i> (1956) and was awarded the DBE in 1957.</p><h2>Birds of America</h2><p><p>Lorrie Moore's dazzling collection of stories is remarkable for its range, emotional force and dark humour, and for the sheer beauty and power of its language. It unfolds a startlingly brilliant series of portraits of the young, the hip, the lost, the unsettled and the unhinged of modern-day America.</p><p></p><p>In what may be her most stunning book yet, Lorrie Moore explores the personal and the universal, the idiosyncratic and the mundane with all of the wit, brio and verve that have made her one of the best storytellers of our time.</p></p><p>Lorrie Moore made her debut in 1985 with <i>Self-Help</i>, which proved that she could write about sadness, sex and the single girl with as much tenderness--and with considerably more wit--than almost any of her contemporaries. She followed this story collection with another, <i>Like Life</i>, as well as two fine novels, <i>Anagrams</i> and <i>Who Will Run the Frog Hospital?</i> Yet Moore's rapid-fire alternation of mirth and deep melancholy is so perfectly suited to the short form that readers will greet <i>Birds of America</i> with an audible sigh of relief--and delight. In "Willing", for example, a second-rate Hollywood starlet retreats into a first-rate depression, taking shelter in a Chicago-area Days Inn. The author's eye for the small comic detail is intact: her juice-bar-loving heroine initially drowns her sorrows in "places called I Love Juicy or Orange-U-Sweet". Yet Moore seldom satisfies herself with mere pop-cultural mockery. She's too interested in the small and large devastations of life, which her actress is experiencing in spades. "Walter leaned her against his parked car," Moore relates. "His mouth was slightly lopsided, paisley-shaped, his lips anneloid and full, and he kissed her hard. There was something numb and on hold in her. There were small dark pits of annihilation she discovered in her heart, in the loosening fist of it, and she threw herself into them, falling." Elsewhere, the author serves up a similar mixture of one- liners and contemporary grief, lamenting the death of a housecat in "Four Calling Birds, Three French Hens" and the death of a marriage in "Which Is More Than I Can Say About That". And her hilarious account of a nuclear family undergoing a meltdown in "Charades" will make you want to avoid parlour games for the rest of your natural life. --<i>James Marcus</i>"A nest of tales that captures the eternal, hummingbird flutter of the human heart. . . . A volume in which everything comes together: the author's mordant, Dorothy Parker wit, the Joycean epiphanies, the Flannery O'Connor-esque moments of clarity and grace." --"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution " <br>"These new stories sparkle; they are keenly and poignantly mindful of the idioms, banalities and canards of contemporary American society, and they hum with Moore's earmark droll and incisive banter, her astonishing ability to render the intricacy of character in a few sharply focused details." --"Houston Chronicle <br>"<br>"Cements [Moore's] reputation as one of our finest writers of fiction." --"Austin American-Statesman "<br>" "<br>"Lorrie Moore has made laughingstocks of all of us.

He was educated at Harvard, at the Sorbonne in Paris, and at Merton College, Oxford. His early poetry was profoundly influenced by the French symbolists, especially Baudelaire and Laforgue. In his academic studies he specialised in philosophy and logic. His doctoral thesis was on F. H. Bradley. He settled in England in 1915, the year in which he married Vivienne Haigh-Wood and also met his contemporary Ezra Pound for the first time. After teaching for a year or so he joined Lloyds Bank in the City of London in 1917, the year in which he published his first volume, Prufrock and Other Observations. In 1919 Poems was hand-printed by Leonard and Virginia Woolf. His first collection of essays, The Sacred Wood, appeared in 1920. His most famous work, The Waste Land, was published in 1922, the same year as James Joyce&#39;s Ulysses. The poem was included in the first issue of his jou&#34;&#39;Each year Eliot&#39;s presence reasserts itself at a deeper level, to an audience that is surprised to find itself more chastened, more astonished, more humble.&#39; Ted Hughes&#34;</p><h2>Painting Your Favorite Animals in Pen, Ink and Watercolor</h2><p><p><b>Paint lively and lovable animals of all kinds!</b></p><p>Capture all the natural charm and personality of your favorite animals.

Whoever was out there was getting impatient. Ringing the bell hadn't been good enough. Now they were knocking, too. Little Catherine had to practically run to keep up, but she wasn't about to be left behind by her nursemaid.<br><br>"Is it a baby?" Catherine asked, easily remembering how her mother would be summoned at all hours to deliveries when she was a midwife, since those calls had stopped only a few short months ago.<br><br>"I hope not," Maeve replied. "Your mama doesn't deliver babies anymore, and besides, she's too far away to help even if she did."<br><br>Maeve pulled open the door and found a middle-aged woman standing on the doorstep. Her hat was obviously the one she saved for "best," although her coat had seen better days. Maeve instantly classified her as one of the people who had started coming to the Malloy house looking for a handout as soon as they discovered her employer, Frank Malloy, had become a millionaire.<br><br>"Is this where the Malloys live?" the woman asked, looking up doubtfully at the imposing fa?ade.<br><br>Malloy and his new bride had decided to wait until they returned from their honeymoon to hire servants, but Maeve was starting to think that had been a terrible mistake. Nothing like a snooty butler to send people on their way.<br><br>"Yes, it is, but-"<br><br>"I'm a friend of Mrs. Malloy. Mrs. Alma Malloy, that is, not the new missus."<br><br>"She's not-"<br><br>"Oh, I know she's not home now," the woman said, twisting her hands anxiously. "She's with the boy at his school, isn't she? I wouldn't know that if I wasn't really her friend, now, would I? But it's not her I was wanting to see, is it? No, it's himself, Mr. Malloy. Francis. I've known him from a boy, I have, and I . . ."<br><br>To Maeve's dismay, the woman burst into tears.<br><br>Maeve glanced up and down the street, checking to see if the woman had brought someone with her. She saw no one else lurking about. Briefly, she debated inviting the woman inside. She and Catherine were there alone, but the woman didn't look dangerous. Besides, how could she shut the door and leave someone sobbing on the stoop?<br><br>"Come in, please," Maeve said, taking the woman's arm and drawing her inside.<br><br>"Why is the lady crying?" Catherine asked.<br><br>The woman stopped dead at the sound of the child's voice and made a visible effort to recover her composure. "And who's this, now?" she asked.<br><br>"This is Mrs. Brandt's . . . I mean, Mrs. Malloy's daughter. The new Mrs. Malloy, that is."<br><br>"Francis's new bride," she said, nodding. "A sweet little thing she is, too."<br><br>"Mr. Malloy is my papa now," Catherine said.<br><br>"Of course he is," she said with a watery smile. "I don't suppose I could speak with Francis, could I? It's very important, you see. A matter of life and death."<br><br>It was always a matter of life and death when people wanted a handout, Maeve thought, but she said, "I'm sorry to say that he's not here, but I'll be happy to tell him you called."<br><br>"I can wait for him. I have to see him right away, you know."<br><br>"You'll have a very long wait, I'm afraid. He's still on his honeymoon, and we don't expect them back for several weeks yet."<br><br>"Several weeks?" she repeated, her eyes flooding with tears again. "But I can't . . . I have to see him. It's my daughter, you see. They've put her in jail, and they say she's done murder, but she never did. She's a good girl, my Una. She would never do what they said, but they're going to hang her unless Francis helps her!"<br><br>Oh dear, this wasn't at all what Maeve had been expecting. And not something Catherine needed to hear about either. She glanced down to see the child's eyes had widened in alarm.<br><br>"Mrs. . . . I'm sorry, I didn't get your name."<br><br>"Mrs. O'Neill, lass. I'm so sorry to bother you, but-"<br><br>"Not at all. Why don't we go into the kitchen, Mrs. O'Neill, and I'll make you a nice cup of tea, and you can tell me all about your daughter."<br><br>"I don't want to be any trouble now, miss."<br><br>"It's no trouble. Mrs. Malloy would never forgive me if I turned away an old friend in need," Maeve lied. Mrs. Malloy generally thought old friends in need were a lot of trouble.<br><br>Maeve would have to distract Catherine somehow first, of course, but before she could come up with a plan, someone else rang their doorbell.<br><br>Wonderful, another visitor.<br><br>With an apologetic smile, she opened the front door again to find their neighbor Mrs. Ellsworth, smiling broadly and carrying a planter filled with sprigs of holly and trailing ivy.<br><br>"Maeve, dear, I've got this little planting for you and . . . Oh my, I didn't know you had company," she said, doing a much better job of lying than even Maeve herself could do, because of course she'd known very well that Maeve had company. Mrs. Ellsworth didn't consider it lying at all, though. People said things that weren't true all the time in polite society. It was just good manners, according to Mrs. Ellsworth.<br><br>Mrs. Ellsworth breezed right in without being invited, and Maeve did not object because they both knew she'd come to see if Maeve needed rescuing from an importunate beggar from the Malloys' old neighborhood. Nothing much happened on Bank Street that Mrs. Ellsworth didn't notice. She would have spotted the strange woman at the Malloys' door in a heartbeat.<br><br>Maeve introduced the two women.<br><br>"Are you quite well, Mrs. O'Neill?" Mrs. Ellsworth inquired, seeing the woman's red-rimmed eyes.<br><br>"Mrs. O'Neill has had some trouble, and she came to ask Mr. Malloy for help. It's detective business," she added, so Mrs. Ellsworth would understand that she didn't need assistance in running Mrs. O'Neill off. Frank Malloy had been a police detective until he came into money, and now he sometimes helped people in trouble. "I was just wondering if Catherine could visit with you for an hour or so while Mrs. O'Neill and I talk, at least until Brian and Mrs. Malloy get home from school."<br><br>"Of course, dear. You know little Catherine is always welcome. I'm just getting ready to make some pies for supper, and I know how she loves to make the lattice crusts. Would you like to help me with that?" she asked the child.<br><br>Plainly, Catherine wanted to stay and find out why this strange lady had been crying, but she was too well trained to refuse the invitation. "Yes, ma'am, I would."<br><br>"That's wonderful," Mrs. Ellsworth said, then seemed to remember the planter she still held. "And this is for your household, Maeve, for Christmas good fortune. The holly brings good luck to men and the ivy brings good luck to us females. We must always have them both together. That's only fair, don't you think? And let me know immediately if the ivy starts to wither. That's a very bad sign. And never burn the holly when it's still green. That's very bad luck."<br><br>Nearly overwhelmed by the detailed instructions while her mind was still on Mrs. O'Neill's problems, Maeve thanked her and took the planter and set it on a table in the hallway. A few moments later, after Catherine had been bundled into her hat and coat, she and Mrs. Ellsworth headed out and across the street to Mrs. Ellsworth's house.<br><br>"This house is . . . very nice," Mrs. O'Neill said, looking around in awe at the massive staircase and the chandelier hanging from the ceiling twenty feet above.<br><br>"Thank you," Maeve said. "I should probably take you into the parlor-"<br><br>"Oh no, the kitchen is fine for the likes of me, lass." She followed as Maeve led the way to the back of the house. "Alma must be very . . . comfortable here."<br><br>"She seems to be," Maeve said, biting back a smile. Mrs. Malloy wasn't the kind of person to let on if she was comfortable or not.<br><br>A few minutes later, Maeve had gotten Mrs. O'Neill to take off her coat and have a seat at the kitchen table while Maeve set water to boil on the newly installed gas stove. It was one of only a few in the entire city, they'd been told. While she waited for the water, she cut a few slices of the pound cake left over from yesterday and arranged them on a plate. By the time the tea was steeping and the cake had been served, over Mrs. O'Neill's polite objections, her guest had calmed down quite a bit.<br><br>"I'm sorry Mr. Malloy isn't here," Maeve began, "but I would be glad to hear your story and help you figure out what to do."<br><br>She smiled sadly. "Oh, lass, there's nothing you can do, I'm sure."<br><br>Maeve smiled. "Don't judge me by my looks, Mrs. O'Neill. I've helped Mr. Malloy solve many a case." It was only a slight exaggeration.<br><br>Mrs. O'Neill frowned. "Oh, surely not."<br><br>"I've also done work for the Pinkerton Detective Agency, so even if I can't help you, I'll know someone who can. Now tell me, why on earth would someone accuse your daughter of committing murder?"<br><br>Her eyes filled with tears again, but she resolutely blinked them back. "I can't hardly believe it myself, but I saw her in the jail with my own eyes. Just sitting there staring at the wall, all covered with blood, she was. She wouldn't say a word to me, not a single word. They said she hasn't said anything at all since it happened."<br><br>"Since what happened?"<br><br>Mrs. O'Neill drew a deep breath and let it out on a shaky sigh. "It's a long story."<br><br>"I'm not going anywhere." Maeve picked up the teapot and poured them each another cup.<br><br>"Well, it all started . . . oh dear, was it only five months ago? Yes, just that. My Una, she's a pretty girl. I'm not bragging. Everyone says so. And she's a good girl, too. Not vain like a lot of pretty girls are."<br><br>"I'm sure," Maeve said, doubting that but nodding her encouragement.<br><br>"She got a job at a factory about a year ago, sewing ladies' clothes. She'd give me her wages every week. I told you, she's a good girl."<br><br>Maeve nodded again.<br><br>"Then one day she came home that excited. A gentleman had seen her and offered her a job in his cigar shop."<br><br>"Seen her where?"<br><br>"Coming out of the factory. He was watching all the girls, and he picked her out special, because she's so pretty."<br><br>This sounded suspicious to Maeve. Men were always trying to take advantage of young women in the city. "Did he really have a cigar shop?"<br><br>"Oh yes. I can see what you're thinking, but I wouldn't let her get tricked into something bad. I went with her to see his shop. He was such a nice man. He liked to have a pretty girl to work behind the counter, he told us. It attracts customers. They come in to flirt with the girl and buy a cigar or two while they're there."<br><br>So long as cigars are all he's selling, Maeve thought.<br><br>"He'd just lost his counter girl because she'd gotten married. That happened to all the girls who'd worked there, he said. One of the customers would fall in love and off she'd go. So Una not only got a good job that paid more than she'd been getting at the factory, she also got a chance to meet a nice young man with prospects."<br><br>"And did she meet someone?"<br><br>"Oh yes. She wasn't there long before Mr. Pollock noticed her. He'd come in nearly every day, she said. Always polite, you understand. Mr. Winter didn't allow his girls to be treated rude. He told me that right off, or I never would've let her go there. And Mr. Pollock, he fell in love with my Una."<br><br>Which was, of course, what all men say when they want to have their way with a girl. Maeve's grandfather had told her that a million times when she was growing up, and in her limited experience, she'd found it to be quite true. "Did Mr. Pollock want to marry Una?"<br><br>"He did. At first she thought he was teasing. A lot of men teased her about getting married, but he was serious. He couldn't convince her at first, but then he asked if he could see her home one evening, to meet me. And when he did, he asked if he could marry my girl."<br><br>This sounded like a fairy tale, but unlike fairy tales, it probably didn't end happily. Something had obviously gone terribly wrong at some point, or Mrs. O'Neill wouldn't need help from Frank Malloy. "Did they get married?"<br><br>"Oh yes, and it wasn't one of those sham marriages either. I was there. I saw it happen. The priest said the words over them all right and proper. But this was only after I went to see his house. He has a beautiful house up in Harlem, on St. Nicholas Avenue. It's where all the rich people are moving. That's what he told us. He has a woman to cook for him and two more to clean and a boy to do the heavy work. And Mr. Pollock, he adored my Una. My girl was going to have the life I always hoped she would. It was like a miracle."<br><br>"But she didn't?"<br><br>"Oh, she did! Mr. Pollock, he bought her new clothes, and she lived in his beautiful house, and they were so happy. She was so happy. I know they were. He adored her."<br><br>She went still, staring off at something only she could see. Maeve waited, not wanting to rush her. Not really wanting to know at all, in fact.<br><br>"They came to me today. The police. Our roundsman, I should say. He knows me, you see. His wife and I go to church together. He told me Una was in the jail and I should go down right away. He told me . . ." Her voice broke, and she covered her face with both hands.<br><br>Maeve waited, her stomach knotted, her fists clenched tightly on the tabletop.<br><br>Finally, Mrs. O'Neill lowered her hands. Her eyes were awful, full of despair. "They said she'd killed him. Killed Mr. Pollock. But how could that be? She loved him. He was her husband!"<br><br>Maeve knew lots of wives would happily murder their husbands and a few who actually had, but she didn't think that information would comfort Mrs. O'Neill. "What did Una say when you saw her in the jail?"<br><br>"Nothing. I told you, she wouldn't say a word. They told me she hadn't said anything at all since they found her."</p><h2>Out of Africa (Vintage Books, V740)</h2><p>In describing her experiences managing a coffee plantation in Kenya, the author provides insight into the nature of African life</p><p>9 1.5-hour cassettesIn this book, the author of <i>Seven Gothic Tales</i> gives a true account of her life on her plantation in Kenya.

Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer, the company's founders, had acquired the Modern Library from publishers Boni and Liveright two years earlier. One day, their friend the illustrator Rockwell Kent stopped by their office. Cerf later recalled, "Rockwell was sitting at my desk facing Donald, and we were talking about doing a few books on the side, when suddenly I got an inspiration and said, 'I've got the name for our publishing house. We just said we were go-ing to publish a few books on the side at random. Let's call it Random House.' Donald liked the idea, and Rockwell Kent said, 'That's a great name. I'll draw your trademark.' So, sitting at my desk, he took a piece of paper and in five minutes drew Random House, which has been our colophon ever since." Throughout the years, the mission of Random House has remained consistent: to publish books of the highest quality, at random. We are proud to continue this tradition today.<br><br>This edition is set from the first American edition of 1937 and commemorates the seventy-fifth anniversary of Random House.</p><h2>Theater Games for Rehearsal: A Director&#39;s Handbook</h2><p>Gives advice on selecting a play, auditioning a cast, and creating a stage space, shows how to conduct acting workshops, and demonstrates rehearsal techniques</p><p></p><h2>He Is My Shepherd: The 23rd Psalm for Children</h2><p>Presents the text of the twenty-third psalm and elaborates on the meaning of each line.</p><p></p><h2>Moment of Christ: The path of meditation</h2><p><p>"Learning to meditate is the most practical thing in the world.

It is a prayer that continues in our heart day and night. John Main describes this prayer as the stream of love that flows constantly between Jesus and his Father. This stream of love is the Holy SpiritIt is John Main's conviction that is it the most important task for any fully human life that we should become as open as possible to this stream of love. In order for us to do this we must learn a way that is a way of silence - of stillness - and this by a discipline that is most demanding.John Main talks about the many aspects of silent prayer: the way of the mantra, leaving distraction behind, fullness of life in love and silence. A striking feature of the book is its emphasis on simplicity, on transcending self-consciousness and moving beyond "techniques" of prayer.</p></p><p>John Main (1926-1982) was a Benedictine mond whom Bede Griffiths once acclaimed &#34;the best spiritual guide in the church today.&#34; His work continues to guide many to deeper spirituality and also to inspire inter-religious dialogue.</p><h2>Braun/Hogenberg.

The decline of this group, a demographic of our country that has been slowly disintegrating over forty years, has been reported on with growing frequency and alarm, but has never before been written about as searingly from the inside.</p><p><p>From a former marine and Yale Law School graduate, a probing look at the struggles of America&#x2019;s white working class through the author&#x2019;s own story of growing up in a poor Rust Belt town.</p><p><em>Hillbilly Elegy</em> is a passionate and personal analysis of a culture in crisis&#x2014;that of poor, white Americans. The disintegration of this group, a process that has been slowly occurring now for over forty years, has been reported with growing frequency and alarm, but has never before been written about as searingly from the inside. In <em>HillbillyElegy</em>, J.D. Vance tells the true story of what a social, regional, and class decline feels like when you were born with it hanging around your neck.</p><p>The Vance family story began with hope in postwar America. J.D.&#x2019;s grandparents were &#x201c;dirt poor and in love&#x201d; and moved north from Kentucky&#x2019;s Appalachia region to Ohio in the hopes of escaping the dreadful poverty around them. They raised a middle-class family, and eventually one of their grandchildren would graduate from Yale Law School, a conventional marker of success in achieving generational upward mobility. But as the family saga of <em>Hillbilly Elegy </em>plays out, we learn that J.D.&#x2019;s grandparents, aunt, uncle, sister, and, most of all, his mother struggled profoundly with the demands of their new middle-class life, never fully escaping the legacy of abuse, alcoholism, poverty, and trauma so characteristic of their part of America. With piercing honesty, Vance shows how he himself still carries around the demons of his chaotic family history.</p><p>A deeply moving memoir, with its share of humor and vividly colorful figures, <em>Hillbilly Elegy </em>is the story of how upward mobility really feels. And it is an urgent and troubling meditation on the loss of the American dream for a large segment of this country.</p><b>J. D. Vance</b> is a former Marine and a graduate of Yale Law School.

With few remaining men and a crumbling stone wall that has seen better days, he confronts an ancient enemy: the sea-borne Stormriders have returned. Religious war also threatens these lands. The cult of the Blessed Lady, which had stood firm against the Riders for millennia, now seeks to eradicate its rivals.

That is, rule by sea power. In the undignified scholarly scramble to identify and distil the empire's early stages this truly defining characteristic is usually overlooked. Yet the Malazan expansion was undeniably one of sea power and this was the key to its early successes. It was also the key to one of its early failures: the ill-conceived incursion into the archipelago and subcontinent known variously as Fist, Korel, or the Storm-cursed. For this archipelago was itself a supreme sea power, if non-expansionist.

Many of the ideas from these bestsellers underpin his latest book, The Undoing Project, which is the result of years of research. Michael Lewis was born in New Orleans and educated at Princeton University and the London School of Economics. He is contributing writer for The New York Times magazine and writes for Vanity Fair and Portfolio magazine.Michael Lewis is a brilliant writer... The Undoing Project is a masterclass in narrative non-fiction -- Steven Poole * Spectator * A new book by Michael Lewis promises an absorbing story, dazzling ideas, journalistic flair and originality. He achieves this with extraordinary consistency. In The Undoing Project he has achieved it again. -- Danny Finkelstein * The Times * Kahneman and Tversky&#39;s deep friendship and intellectual collaboration has arguably done as much to define our world as, say, the intertwining between Francis Crick and James Watson... Michael Lewis, with his great gift for humanising complex and abstract ideas, is exactly the storyteller Tversky and Kahneman deserve. -- Tim Adams * Observer * I normally write two or three pages of notes when reviewing a book. On this occasion I scribbled six, often in high excitement. Lewis has a strong journalist&#39;s sense of a good story and the book is dotted with hundreds. He also has a feeling for pace and intensity. Although this is an easy read, nothing is wasted and everything seems to be in the right place. And what a story it is! -- Bryan Appleyard * Sunday Times * Michael Lewis is perhaps my favourite writer full stop. At his best, Lewis engages both heart and brain like no author, and he tells the story of Tversky and Kahneman beautifully... the final sections will have you weeping -- Robert Colvile * Daily Telegraph * Leaves you feeling cleverer -- Katie Law * Evening Standard * Part biography of a friendship and part account of psychology&#39;s impact, while also taking in much of modern Israel&#39;s history, this is a fine showcase of Mr Lewis&#39;s range ... it is a story of remarkable individuals succeeding through innovative ideas ...

Owned by local resident Craig Common, who also works as Executive Chef, The Common Grill is a delightful combination of big city cuisine, bountiful beverages, to-die-for desserts and casual atmosphere. In the nine years since its opening, the restaurant has consistently received outstanding reviews and ratings from critics and patrons alike. Chef Common, however, is well aware that many people enjoy cooking as much as he does. So within these pages youll find recipes to inspire the experienced home cook as well as the beginner.</p><p>First of all, there is nothing common about this cookbook, and it is not about grilling. Rather, it is a compilation of more than 150 recipes from the Common Grill, chef Craig Common's restaurant in the quaint town of Chelsea, Michigan. Common's food has been described as a combination of "big city" and "casual comfort," and with recipes such as Grilled Portobello Mushrooms with Warm Garlic Custard, it's easy to see why.<p> Common's work is well organized. He starts with a chapter of basics, such as stocks, basil pesto, and a roasted-tomato sauce, and then presents a chapter of sauces, some of which are called for later in the book and some of which will make a dish all on their own. A little note at the end of a recipe for Mint Aioli says, "A great addition to grilled lamb chops"; Tomato and Roasted Pepper Compote is "great on grilled fish"; and Bacon-Balsamic Vinaigrette is used in a salmon recipe but would be tasty also on a spinach salad.</p><p> Once you get past the basics, however, Common gets less common and more complicated. While there are a number of recipes with short lists of ingredients and manageable time frames, such as Skillet-Roasted Mussels, Dungeness Crab Cakes, and Apple Praline French Toast, most are quite complex and time-consuming, requiring a bit of expertise in the kitchen. Fortunately, many are beautifully photographed and all are laid out well, with the lists of ingredients separated into mini-recipes and printed on an off-white background to help you keep your place as you look back and forth at the instructions alongside. Tuna Salad Ni�oise, for example, is a work of art, made with fresh Ahi tuna and served on mesclun with beans, potatoes, asparagus, cherry tomatoes, and ricotta or feta cheese with Roasted Lemon-Basil Vinaigrette. The recipes for the Tuna Marinade and the vinaigrette are called out separately.</p><p> Pan-Seared Whitefish with Cajun Ragout Sauce, Chilean Sea Bass with New Bedford Littleneck Clams, and Roasted Vegetable Cannelloni are all worth the trouble, but the key to these recipes is to really read them, as the instructions sometimes oversimplify the work involved. While this book is certainly something a kitchen novice could aspire to, it is geared more toward cooks who are already quite comfortable in the kitchen. For them, Common is sure to be a source of inspiration. <i>--Leora Y. Bloom</i></p></p><h2>Drama of the Lost Disciples</h2><p>In A.D. 33 the most power-packed drama in the history of Mankind was acted out when Roman soldiery nailed Jesus Christ to the cross at the instigation of the fanatical leadership of the Sanhedrin. Though seemingly unimportant at the time this incident was followed by the most important and significant event in all of history . . . the resurrection of Jesus Christ. From this unique &amp; unparalleled event sprang the greatest missionary movement of all time as His disciples began to take His Kingdom message (as He had instructed them to do) to the "lost sheep" of the House of Israel. This book documents the travels of not just the twelve disciples but many more after they left Judea &amp; journeyed to distant lands. The list includes Joseph of Arimathea, Mary the mother of Jesus, Mary Magdalene, Lazarus, Paul, Peter &amp; scores of others. Although the title implies the disciples were "lost" they were really only lost to history for a while. This author did not rely on tradition or fanciful tales. Rather he researched historical sources for the information; ancient Roman French British and Greek manuscripts. The volume of evidence is amazing and exciting. It confirms that Joseph of Arimathea carried the word to Great Britain in A.D. 36. Mr. Jowett also demonstrates that ancient Britains were not barbarians as they have so often been described by the establishment historian. There was a well organized society in the 1st century. In fact Britain was the only land that Rome could not conquer. Nation after nation fell before Roman armies for hundreds of years but not the British Isles. One doesn't have to be British or of British ancestry to develop as you read a great sense of sympathy and affection for these early Christians who gave their lives in defense of home family and church so their descendants would have the freedoms they now enjoy.

Ten years earlier, a massacre killed off all adults, leaving just child survivors known as savants, who are mutants endowed with skills that, once brought under control, can be used in ways to contribute to the survival of the community. Many of the them, however, require heavy medication and rarely live to adulthood. Those that die turn into shades, zombielike creatures that retain the memories of their past life and inhabit dead bodies. Jonah is a talented musician, enchanter, and trained assassin. His skin is poisonous and he can kill from a simple touch; his job is to rid the world of shades. Emma is also a talented musician, but unlike Jonah, she is not aware of her special abilities. The teens are star-crossed lovers with overwhelming obstacles blocking their paths. As Emma's world slowly converges with Jonah's, both of their lives spin into a chaotic downward spiral. Scattered with musical references throughout, the book also tackles serious themes of disability and discrimination. The cliff-hanger ending will leave readers restless for more.

Sabrina Carnesi, Crittenden Middle School, Newport News, VA SLJ"<br><br>Someone is killing wizards and framing Nightshade, the secret organization whose job it is to track down undead souls and dispatch them. Jonah, a 17-year-old assassin for Nightshade, is also on the trail of wizard killers, but for a different reason: he wants to know who was behind the Thorn Hill disaster, where thousands of adult sorcerers and nearly as many children died. Meanwhile, teen musical genius Emma, in search of her sorcerer father, lands directly in Jonah's path. He is smitten, but can he save her from those who think she knows the secret to Thorn Hill? There is plenty of background information in the interstices of this multifaceted narrative, but readers new to the Heir Chronicles series may occasionally have difficulty connecting all the dots. Intriguing plot and subplot teasers abound, and the book ends in a cliffhanger that will have readers roaring for the next entry. Chima continues to excel at building tension and populating her well-told tales with new and returning characters we want to know better. HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY: It's a big series with a big following. Author tour, book trailer, and more promise to keep the swords a-swinging.- Cindy Welch Booklist"<br><br>Chima returns to her best-selling contemporary fantasy series with an entry that is almost entirely setup-but such delicious setup. Ten years ago, something terrible happened at the magical commune of Thorn Hill, a refuge from vicious Weir infighting. Thousands died, leaving only a few hundred young children, horribly damaged and with mutated gifts. Jonah is one of those survivors, born a charismatic and empathetic enchanter but now cursed with a killing touch, which he reluctantly employs to hunt down the undead spawn of the massacre. Meanwhile, Emma scarcely remembers Thorn Hill and knows nothing of her sorcerous heritage, until her grandfather's murder sends her fleeing into the epicenter of Weir intrigue, prejudice, accusations and assassination. There are so many complicated storylines introduced here-characters old and new, factions with shifting allegiances and agendas, plots and counterplots and secrets and lies-that the protagonists don't even meet for over 100 pages, and the volume ends on grisly cliffhanger. Yet the twisty narrative works, propelled by the deft characterizations of tortured, frustrated, desperate Jonah and fierce, feral, determined Emma and held together by the ubiquitous soundtrack of the blues, both literally and metaphorically. Chima orchestrates a world gravid with smoke and grit and sudden death, throbbing with hopeless longings, messy affections, festering resentments, passionate hungers, inevitable betrayals, and miraculous flashes of beauty and grace. A smoldering story soaked in tears, sweat and blood, constantly threatening to blaze into an inferno. Spellbinding. (Fantasy, 14 &amp; up) Kirkus"<br><br>When Jonah was seven, a mysterious mass poisoning swept through the Thorn Hill commune, leaving the adults dead and most of the children either dead or altered, their innate magical abilities mutated in unpredictable ways. Jonah himself, for instance, can kill with a soothing, bliss-filled touch. Gabriel Mandrake has formed a school for the survivors near Trinity, Ohio, where, as readers of the first three Heir Chronicles (The Warrior Heir, BCCB 7/06, etc.) will recall, the Weir Council has formed a shaky peace among the still suspicious and antagonistic guilds. Now, however, wizards are being killed, and Gabriel has assembled a group of young assassins to dispatch the undead spirits of Jonah's commune, who have also migrated to Ohio and are seeking bodies to possess. Jonah excels at this task, but he's having second thoughts about both Gabriel's motives and his tactics. While compulsively readable and full of features that make readers glom on to the paranormal romances, this entry has a good many gaps in the world-building that will leave even committed readers frustrated. New terminology regarding the guilds is introduced without explanation, the timeline doesn't clearly correlate to the other books', and the ending offers no intermediate closure. The romance is also problematic: Emma, a girl who somehow survived the Thorn Hill Massacre with no knowledge of the Weir world of which her parents were a part, placidly accepts the new information about her heritage without so much as a blink and inexplicably falls in love with Jonah while he is tying her up and setting out to interrogate her father. These flaws may not bother readers previously blinded by sparkly vampires, but as those readers are less likely to commit to series as complex as this one, expect some mild disappointment along with howling clamors for the next book. KC BCCB"<br><br>4Q5P An unexplained tragedy left no adult survivors from the thriving Thorn Hill community in Brazil and less than a thousand children to be rescued and brought back to the States. These children were not just left with emotional scars, they were changed at their most basic magical and physical levels. Calling themselves savants, the Thorn Hill children have become teens with serious magical complications that make them dangerous to ignore; Jonah Kinlock can kill with a single touch. Torn between his gentle heart and his magic, Jonah is starting to question what he believes about the status quo when Emma Greenwood appears. True, Emma's got her own secrets, but there are intriguing hints that she might be the key to understanding what happened in Thorn Hill. Can Jonah battle his hormones, keep his deadly secret, and still win Emma's trust before it is too late? Teens will be more than relieved when they can finally put their hands on this next, long-awaited entry in the Heir Chronicles series. Jonah and Emma, along with a collection of secondary characters, deal with half-truths and lies hidden in their own histories while finding unexpected connections that continue developing storylines from previous books in the series. The fighting and weaponry will have strong appeal for boys, while the musical references will appeal to any teen interested in crafting their own music, lyrics, or poetry. The surprise ending, with plenty of loose threads left hanging, will intrigue and frustrate fans who now must begin to wait all over again.-Stacey Hayman VOYA"</p><h2>The Art of the Bookplate</h2><p>This jewel of a volume, beautiful to look at and the per-fect gift for booklovers, traces the origins, development, and exquisite designs of the personalized bookplate.

Although both Jim and his wife, Ginger Ormiston, had jobs in the complex of buildings that made up the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan, they rarely went to work together. Their two children, Beth and Billie, went to different schools in different parts of the city, and mornings sometimes resembled a fire drill as the four of them scrambled to shower, eat breakfast, dress, and get off to school or work. <br><br>As usual, Jim was the first one up that Tuesday. He headed into the kitchen to start the coffee, then went to wake the kids. Billie, who was ten, was the hardest to rouse. But he had to get ready first since he had an early school bus to catch. Billie was just starting the fifth grade at P.S. 6 on the Upper East Side. A school bus stopped at University Place, near Jim and Ginger&#x2019;s apartment off Union Square, but Billie had to be there by 7:30 to catch it. He had missed the bus the previous day and Ginger had to take him to school on the subway, which in turn had made her late for work at her new job as a computer expert with Marsh &amp; McLennan.<br><br>After getting the children up, Jim went back to the kitchen to start making breakfast for Beth and Billie. He heard the shower running and knew that Ginger was up. Once the kids were fed, Jim started his own shower while Ginger dressed. He was just getting out when he heard Ginger shout something to him and the front door close. He didn&#x2019;t hear what she said, and he called out to her from the bathroom. But she was gone.<br><br>Jim had first met Ginger seventeen years earlier at the wedding of a mutual friend in Pittsburgh. No sparks flew immediately, but when they met again at another wedding two years later, Jim asked Ginger for a date. When they started going out, Ginger and Jim did not seem to have a lot in common. Jim, who was born in Baltimore but grew up in Florida, was working for a small law firm. He loved New York. Ginger, who had an electrical engineering degree from Rutgers and was taking night courses at New York University, still lived with her parents in New Jersey while working at Bell Labs. She was not all that fond of the city. Jim liked baseball and had season tickets to the Yankees, but Ginger did not care much for the game; Jim liked the ballet, while Ginger preferred the opera. But there were many things they both enjoyed. They both loved to try the food of different countries, for example, a pleasure that New York, with its many restaurants, offered. Two years later, Jim and Ginger were married. <br><br>They moved into Jim&#x2019;s little one-bedroom bachelor apartment on 17th Street in Manhattan, but after Beth and Billie were born, it became clear they would have to find a bigger place to live. First, they looked for a house in the suburbs, but in the end it was Ginger who decided she did not want to leave Manhattan. The girl from the Jersey suburbs had become a dyed-in-the-wool New Yorker. Eventually, they found a loft near Union Square in downtown Manhattan. It was more than they could afford, and it needed a lot of work. But it became their dream house. <br><br>After Billie was born, Ginger stopped working for a while. But when they bought the loft, she knew she would have to find a job again. She started with a big corporation, but after a time she felt she wanted more of a challenge, and over the past year Ginger had changed jobs three or four times, signing on with different start-up Internet companies that always began with great fun, fanfare, and promise but then fizzled as the enterprises ran out of money. She was hoping her new job at M &amp; M, as the giant insurance company was known, would become permanent. <br><br>After Ginger left with Billie that morning, Jim and Beth finished dressing and started out toward Beth&#x2019;s school. Beth, who was twelve, was in the eighth grade at New York City Lab School, which was only four blocks away, on 17th Street in Chelsea. Beth was still talking about her soccer match <br><br>the previous Sunday. Soccer had become a big part of the Kenworthys&#x2019; lives, and both Beth and Billie played soccer for neighborhood teams, Beth for both a girls&#x2019; and a boys&#x2019; team. After dropping Beth off at her school, Jim strolled over to Seventh Avenue and turned south. There is a subway stop at 18th Street and Seventh Avenue, and the train would take Jim directly to the World Trade Center and his job with Deloitte &amp; Touche, an accounting firm. But it was such a beautiful day, he decided to walk the forty-odd blocks to work.<br><br>He had just reached the corner of Canal Street when, from somewhere behind and above him, Jim heard a loud noise. He turned around and looked up. It was an airplane flying perilously low over the city. In fact, the big jetliner was so low that it stopped him in his tracks, and he stood watching it from the sidewalk as it streaked south.<br><br>The plane listed slightly, then righted itself and, as Jim watched, flew straight into the side of the North Tower of the World Trade Center. Fire and smoke shot out of the building. Jim immediately began counting down the floors from the top of the 110-story skyscraper to where the plane had disappeared into the building. He counted 14.

With TDC, her works have shared the stage with such companies as the New York City Ballet, the Houston Ballet and Doug Varone &amp; Dancers among many others. After graduating from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, NYC, Ms. Gray began her professional dance career as a principal dancer and Managing Director of Austin on Tap, one of the busiest touring tap companies in the l980's. As a soloist, she has since shared the stage with such tap greats as Steve Condos, Jimmy Slyde, Lon Chaney, Chuck Green, Sarah Petronio, Brenda Bufalino and Savion Glover among many others. Ms. Gray was chosen as one of 12 dancers worldwide to work with tap legend Charles "Honi" Coles in America's first Creative Residency in the art of tap at the Colorado Dance Festival and again in l990 with Jimmy Slyde. She has appeared in The Great Tap Reunion, Tap/Dowop, Chicago on Tap, the Las Vegas Tribute to Cholly Atkins, Just Friends with Sarah Petronio and the PBS documentary Honi Coles - A Class Act. Ms. Gray is an original steering committee member of the International Tap Association, Artistic Director/Tap of the Dance Arts Institute of America and is currently on faculty for Austin Community College and The TDC Academy. She has also taught for the International Summer School/Cyprus, Dance Masters of America, the Dance Center of Columbia College, the Colorado Dance Festival, Chicago on Tap, the University of Texas, the Texas Association Teachers of Dance and numerous other college, theatre and community dance organizations. In addition to Tapestry works, her choreography has been commissioned by Ballet Austin, St. Louis' Tapsichore, numerous modern dance choreographers and equity productions of She Loves Me, Cabaret, Man of La Mancha and Nunsense! Ms. Gray continues as choreographer, collaborator, educator and dancer in the effort to bridge the gap between traditional and contemporary views of dance and American rhythm tap."Acia Gray has compiled and documented so much of the tap dance nomenclature in <em>The Souls of Your Feet</em> that is should now be clear to everyone that this artform is so deep it takes a lifetime to master and yet we're still not finished inventing it. The teacher, the scholar and the dancer in search of identification and clarification of tap terms and basic rhythm structures will find Ms. Gray's vast and inclusive guide a very helpful resource."

From the human side of this equation it is meditative prayer that ushers us into this divine-human fellowship." Richard Foster, bestselling author and founder of Renovar�, writes these words as one who has experienced what they describe. And in this new book he will beautifully guide you in this transformational way, that you might come to know deeper fellowship with God. Weaving together quotes and stories from the lives of mothers and fathers of the faith as well as powerful encounters with God from his own life, Foster describes the riches of quieting your mind and heart in order to listen to and obey God more closely. Along the way, at perhaps his clearest, most practical best, he also provides the biblical teaching and step-by-step help you need to begin this prayer practice for yourself. The journey into meditative prayer is not easy, but it is essential. And, as Foster shows, it's possible, even in the midst of the noisy, often chaotic world we live in. Your soul can become a sanctuary where you fellowship with the very God of the universe, who knows you and loves you deeply. These pages point the way.</p><p>"This is Richard Foster at his best--describing the inner life with clarity and wisdom gained from his own experience. The content of this book, as experienced through his teaching, changed my life thirty years ago, opening me to a real, vibrant relationship with God through silence and listening. Over time this teaching has matured, and is destined to become a classic. If you want to experience an intimate relationship with God, simply read this book and put it into practice. Heaven awaits!" (James Bryan Smith, author, The Good and Beautiful God)<br><br>"Full of depth and substance, Foster's writing on meditative prayer is a winsome invitation to intimacy with God that engages us at every level of our being." (Ruth Haley Barton, founder, Transforming Center, and author of Sacred Rhythms)<br><br>"Richard Foster diagnoses this generation's major threat to the mature life in Christ as <em>distraction</em>. In response he does again what he does so well: tunnels to the roots of our deep-rooted ancestors and makes us firsthand participants in the church's practice of a life of meditative prayer." (Eugene H. Peterson, translator of The Message)<strong>Richard J. Foster</strong> (D.Th.P., Fuller Theological Seminary) is founder of Renovar� in Denver, Colorado.

Craig</b> was the author of nineteen novels in the Martha's Vineyard Mystery series. A professor emeritus of English at Wheelock College in Boston, he loved the Vineyard and lived there year-round with his wife, Shirley.Two fine mystery writers team up for the third and last time (after Second Sight and First Light), with their series heroes swapping chapters and stories seamlessly. Tapply's Boston lawyer, Brady Coyne, responds to an anguished call for help from an old client living on Martha's Vineyard, where the late Philip Craig's ex-cop, J.W. Jackson, is being urged by his wife to investigate the death of a striking ferry boat worker. The authors, real-life friends, could not have gotten along better than their fictional heroes, who share a love of fishing, eating, family and adventure. The two friends pursue their cases separately and together as tensions caused by the ferry strike mount and a murder raises the stakes. This marks the highly enjoyable and poignant end to a short, sweet series. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

My name is Robbie Brownlaw, and I am a homicide detective for the city of San Diego. I am twenty-nine years old.</em></p><p>I now have synesthesia, a neurological condition where your senses get mixed up. Sometimes when people talk to me, I see their voices as colored shapes provoked by the emotions of the speakers, not by the words themselves. I have what amounts to a primitive lie detector. After three years, I don't pay a whole lot of attention to the colors and shapes of other people's feelings, unless they don't match up with their words.</p><p>When Garrett Asplundh's body is found under a San Diego bridge, Robbie Brownlaw and his partner, McKenzie Cortez, are called on to the case. After the tragic death of his child and the dissolution of his marriage, Garrett -- regarded as an honest, straight-arrow officer -- left the SDPD to become an ethics investigator, looking into the activities of his former colleagues. At first his death, which takes place on the eve of a reconciliation with his ex, looks like suicide, but the clues Brownlaw and Cortez find just don't add up. With pressure mounting from the police and the city's politicians, Brownlaw fights to find the truth, all the while trying to hold on to his own crumbling marriage. Was Garrett's death an "execution" or a crime of passion, a personal vendetta or the final step in an elaborate cover-up? Amid rampant corruption and tightening city purse strings, whatever conclusion Brownlaw comes to, the city of San Diego -- and Brownlaw's life -- hangs in the balance.</p><p>A carefully woven novel of suspense, <em>The Fallen</em> brings to life a superb cast of characters against the all-too-real backdrop of a city fighting for its survival. Hailed by critics as "a powerhouse writer" (<em>New York Times</em>) and "a thinking man's bestseller" (<em>Washington Post</em>), T. Jefferson Parker delivers his most elegantly written, suspenseful, and moving novel yet.</p></p><p><p>T. Jefferson Parker is the bestselling author of seventeen novels, including the Edgar Award winners <em>California Girl</em> and <em>Silent Joe</em>. Alongside Dick Francis and James Lee Burke, he is one of only three writers who has won the Edgar Award for Best Novel more than once. Parker lives with his family in Southern California.</p>Murder mystery meets sci-fi in this story about a cop affected after a fall by "post-traumatic swelling" of the brain. The injury leaves Homicide Detective Robbie Brownlaw able to judge people by seeing colors they emanate while speaking (red for lying, etc.). David Colacci's tenor voice doesn't have the range needed to successfully portray Brownlaw's female partner, McKenzie Cortez. And Colacci grates on the listener by starting nearly every sentence LOUD, then trailing off. . . LOUD, then trailing off. . . LOUD, then trailing off. . . . There's a great line in the story that describes the performance itself. It won't make your heart pound "like a dryer full of sneakers."

She worked as an undercover detective, a motorcycle racer, a translator for Radio Free Europe, and a bullfighter before turning to writing. She was a friend of Ernest Hemingway, who said she knew more about bullfighting than any other woman.Eleven-year-old Manolo Olivar has a painful secret: He&#39;s terrified of bulls. Unfortunately, his father was Juan Olivar, the greatest bullfighter in all Spain. How can Manolo find the courage to face his first bull and live up to the expectations of the townspeople of Arcangel? Manolo&#39;s personal quest for manhood in the looming shadow of a father whose memory has faded into folklore becomes both a fascinating adventure and glimpse inside the bullring of the Spanish torero. Francisco Rivela, an actor and native of Spain, reads with an intimacy perfect for young Manolo&#39;s darkly pained tone. At the same time, his crisp, haunting Spanish accent propels the reader into the world of fear and death that shrouds the dreams of every torero.

While the adaptor's changes seem aimed at making the story more accessible to contemporary readers, this pared-down version unfortunately lacks the spirit of Alcott's creation. Dialogue has been edited to make it simpler and more straightforward, but much of the poetry and language of the time has been lost. Also missing are the subtle but realistic details and descriptions that create the sense of the era. Sprightly line-and-wash illustrations complement the theme of good humor and family love. The full-page spreads are framed in country patterned borders, which add to the feeling of nostalgic storytelling. Like the text, the illustrations are adequate, but lack richness and character.

How much do we understand about our own past?

With unflinching candor, humor, and affection, Abish re-creates the way it feels to be a child and to look at your parents and wonder who they are. To be an adult and catch them in every corner of your personality. To look back on the world of your youth and realize both what you noticed and what you missed. It is a stunning achievement.</p><p>Walter Abish is the author of three novels, three collections of short stories, and a book of poems.

That&#x2019;s why my head is shaped the way it is. That&#x2019;s why my eyes are blue. We are talking about genes. About inherited traits. The way I smile&#x2014;reluctantly. The way I reveal my anger. The reason I walk in a certain way. Is there no freedom at all from the family? The efficiently cool and remote mother and the energetic businessman father. Their distinctly separate worlds, their separate concerns collide uneasily in my brain. I would like to think that together, though each not communicating his or her desire to the other, they managed, if you will, to fabricate a writer. They, who essentially did not and could not know how a writer functions, by their approach, their passion, their view of everyday life, combined to turn me into one. It was their unspoken plan&#x2014;a desire they had never voiced. Evidently a desire so secret that after I became a writer they continued to withhold their approval for fear that I might yet change my mind. &#x201c;Ah, a writer!&#x201d; My father glanced doubtfully at me, not wishing to say anything that might wound me. &#x201c;A risky business!&#x201d; On the other hand he couldn&#x2019;t restrain his enthusiastic approval at my driving skill&#x2014;&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a far better driver than Frank&#x201d;&#x2014;when, on one of his infrequent visits to New York in the early seventies, I picked him up at La Guardia and drove him to our home. It may have been the first time he had seen me at the wheel of a car. From him, this favorable comparison to Frank&#x2014;a close friend of the family and, in the U.S., his business partner&#x2014;was the ultimate compliment. Was it that he had never been led to expect much from me? Observing me drive well may have given him a little more confidence in my general capabilities. Driving was one thing he could judge me by. Clearly, in that respect I had passed with honors.<br><br>How readily I was able to identify with my sophisticated mother, and yet, in retrospect, it&#x2019;s my father I love unabashedly. No complications there. I love him, I have to admit, because he is so easy to love. He concealed his complications, if any. He didn&#x2019;t burden anyone with the intricacies of his thoughts. He hid everything but his overwhelming affection and generosity. His readiness to help, to give of himself: today he&#x2019;d be labeled a softie. Not infrequently he was censured for this. All the same, for many he was exemplary&#x2014;ideal, special. Yet, wasn&#x2019;t there also underlying this near-unanimous esteem and praise (&#x201c;Ah, Herr Abish, a wonderful man!&#x201d;) a mild condescension? As if his conscientiousness and trustworthiness&#x2014;or more likely, his reluctance to shine&#x2014;implied a deficiency? Indeed, he disliked being the center of attention. Receiving gifts made him uncomfortable. He was easy to love. He was emotionally predictable&#x2014;by that I mean he didn&#x2019;t ever seem to question or measure the degree to which he was fond of someone. There was a perseverance to his attachments. In his uncomplicated way he did not seem to waver in his commitments. Whereas for my mother, attachment, like so much else, was transitory. It had first to be examined for probable flaws, for defects. So much seemed to be at stake&#x2014;above all, one&#x2019;s self-esteem, one&#x2019;s picture of oneself. My mother preferred to control the display of her emotions, control&#x2014;to the degree this was possible&#x2014;any expression or even sign of love. I suspect to heighten the love she might have felt, it needed to be made more tangible, it needed to be staged. Then, only then, like any well-rehearsed performance, it could be both exquisite and irresistible. For one thing, it enabled me, as the infrequent recipient of her love, to appreciate the setting in which the emotions were given their release&#x2014;in order to what? Wasn&#x2019;t it to love as tentatively and as provisionally but with a kind of exquisite grace?<br><br>But why did they have me? I was the wrong child for them. I provided far too little satisfaction, far too little pleasure. Everything in me spelled out a meager diet. It was as if, all along, I had known that I was merely a capricious factor and not the ineluctable concept that fed their notion of a family. True, my pres- ence permitted them to perform their roles more effectively. My presence&#x2014;trying as it may have been at times&#x2014;encouraged them to go on with their daily lives, safe in the knowledge that as &#x201c;parents&#x201d; they now would be free of criticism. I arrived to regulate their lives, to accentuate the &#x201c;willed&#x201d; normality of their coexistence. When I arrived, there was already a schedule awaiting me. Every possible eventuality was taken into consideration. Was it not from a need to avoid the unexpected? I neatly slipped into a niche, my everyday needs and expectations anticipated&#x2014;or so it seemed. In turn my mother gracefully glided into a caring maternal role, while my father, lacking my mother&#x2019;s innate skill and intuition, adopted the role of father in the way he had come to accept business opportunities that came his way, gravely and responsibly. Not much personal involvement was required of him. To think that they accomplished this without any prior rehearsal, without any prior instructions! There must have been a Viennese Dr. Spock or Dr. Skinner to guide them. But did they prepare for me the way one apprehensively prepares for a relative who for months has threatened to visit&#x2014;a visit that has no end in sight? They furnished my room&#x2014;so confident were they of my arrival. Yes, shortly after their wedding, when the apartment was being redecorated, my future tastes were already being taken into consideration. My mother was preoccupied with the selection of an appropriate name for me. Was it to be G�nther, Peter, Fritz, Georg, Ernst, Franz, Adalbert, Maximilian, Magnus? No easy matter, for did not the name define everything that was to take place? As far as my father was concerned, without his having to give the matter a great deal of thought, I was destined to step into his well-polished shoes and, in time, become a successful perfumer. My mother, I surmise, may have had more elaborate and high-minded designs. Each contributed to what I presently am. Each contributed to the doubt and uncertainty that permeate the life of a writer.<br><br>I accepted them as parents and yet, in the innermost recess of my mind, I must have remained bewildered to see them together. United. For I sensed they were not&#x2014;at any rate, not then. Later, much later, yes. What was it that I failed to recognize? I did not see them together often and long enough to recognize anything. What, then, did I find so disquieting? Was it the logic that dictated their shared agendas? The practical motives? The monotonous yet reassuring routine? The harmonious&#x2014;isn&#x2019;t that the appropriate word?&#x2014;routine of everyday life? Was there something about this pattern that enraged me? Was my spitefully divisive rebelliousness a prewriterly criticism of the then-prevailing bourgeois values: an awareness that the rules of conduct my parents observed so religiously were rules that would, if one permitted them, also flatten all joy in life? Maybe so. All my tantrums accomplished was to bring my parents closer together. My father regarded me with serious concern. He could not decipher the symptoms. And my mother? Ah, she decoded everything: every sidelong glance, every hesitant pause, each time I gritted my teeth, every time I clenched my fist.<br><br>I was their product. Their first and, it turned out, their sole product. They showed a total lack of interest in trying once more, if only in order to improve the model. &#x201c;Certainly not!&#x201d; my mother replied sharply to the gentleman who with great presumption had inquired (in my presence, no less) if she wasn&#x2019;t intending to have another child. I couldn&#x2019;t be sure if her marked look of distaste was directed at the man who had so tactlessly raised the question or if it might not be a natural reaction to the thought, the mere suspicion, that my identifying mark, my supercilious smirk, would be stamped like a trademark on the face of the next child. In any event, her terse response was entirely consistent with my prescient view of myself. Largely isolated from the company of other children, I daily breathed the air of my mother&#x2019;s sharp, uncompromising skepticism and my father&#x2019;s unreason- able optimism. It was an optimism that withstood our many challenges&#x2014;the invincible optimism that continued to defy us, soaring high above our heads, my mother&#x2019;s and mine, flourishing there despite our ceaseless attempts to ground it. How fortunate my father was not to share our interests&#x2014;not to speak our language! For was it not always a censorious and fault-finding language, a language replete with subtexts befitting a critic?<br><br>*****<br><br>I was their only child. I was there to observe them, to watch their comings and goings. I was put there to fuel my mother&#x2019;s frustration. In that respect, each one of us managed to give a flawless performance. My enterprising father, in and out of the house like clockwork. Undemanding, unobservant. Alert only to what interested him. There was little in the house&#x2014;my mother&#x2019;s domain&#x2014;that held his attention. He preferred the tranquillity of his beloved Viennese cafes, these cozy retreats where he could read his newspapers and journals undisturbed. I suspect that the cafes ranked second in importance only to his business, to his treasured perfumes&#x2014;those tiny, elegantly shaped bottles snugly encased in their pale yellow boxes bearing the name Molinard as well their poetic fragrances: Ambre, Iles d&#x2019;Or, Habanita, Fleurettes, Orval. Whenever my father would pull out his handkerchief, the entire room, within seconds, was filled with the delicate fragrance of those evocative names. My mother did not conceal her preference f...</p><h2>Set the Trumpet to Thy Mouth</h2><p>The book will bring a cry of joy from the young preachers who are asking for a spiritual voice compelling the church back to her original calling of holiness and power.</p><p></p><h2>Open Field: An Anthology of Contemporary Canadian Poets</h2><p><p><strong>An unparalleled compilation of more than twenty-five innovative poets, selected from the dazzling panorama of contemporary Canadian verse.</strong></p><p>Included in this unparalleled collection are Christian B�k, Anne Carson, and Erin Mour�, whose experiments with genre have landed them international acclaim; Lisa Robertson and Ken Babstock, whose explorations of the pastoral and the sonnet, respectively, reach as far back into poetry&#x2019;s history as they do into the future of those forms; George Elliot Clarke, whose striking lyrics have been adapted for opera; and Tim Lilburn, Don McKay, and Jan Zwicky, who have reinvented some of poetry&#x2019;s primordial components from the wilder fringes of the Canadian landscape.</p><p>Along with Nicole Brossard, Dionne Brand, Christopher Dewdney, Susan Goyette, Dennis Lee, Daphne Marlatt, Michael Ondaantje, Fred Wah, and others, these poets have been carefully chosen to convey the exhilarating commotion and diversity of Canadian verse.

Warren</strong> <p><b>Lisa Gardner:</b> D.D.--What do you find most fascinating/frustrating about working with the new guy, crime scene expert Alex Wilson?<br> <b>D.D.:</b> Alex seems sharp. Knows his blood spatter--I respect that in a guy. &#x2018;Course, he&#x2019;s been teaching at the Academy, which is one thing, while we&#x2019;re now standing in a Dorchester home with five dead and carnage in every room. I don&#x2019;t want lectures, I want results. This was a family--according the neighbors, even a nice family who seemed to actually like one another. Until, of course, the father snapped and killed them all. Or did he? These are the kinds of questions I gotta ask, and Prof Alex better be ready to answer.</p> <p><b>LG:</b> When did you know you were going to have your own novel?<br> <b>D.D.:</b> First time I walked on scene in <em>Alone</em>. Please, I&#x2019;m five times tougher than fellow detective Bobby Dodge and twenty times smarter. Plus, I look damn good in Jimmy Choos. Let&#x2019;s see the former sniper do my job in my heels, then we&#x2019;ll talk.</p> <p><b>LG:</b> What's the most difficult case you've ever had to handle? Why? <br> <b>D.D.:</b> These past two family homicides. For one thing, any crime involving kids wrecks you a little. For another...I don&#x2019;t believe in coincidence. Here are two families, totally different neighborhoods, socioeconomics, lifestyles, etc., yet they both wind up the same way, dead. Now, what are the odds of two totally different fathers going whacko in exactly the same way? I don&#x2019;t believe it, but my boss isn&#x2019;t into gut feel. All comes down to evidence. I would like some. Really, it would be nice right about now. Yo, Alex...</p> <p><b>LG:</b> What is the thing you love most about being a Boston P.D. Sergeant?<br> <b>D.D.:</b> Being in charge, calling all the shots, being the boss. Did I mention being in charge?</p> <p><b>LG:</b> What's on your nightstand? What's in the drawer?<br> <b>D.D.:</b> On my nightstand--back issue of the FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin I keep meaning to read. In the drawer--emergency stash of chocolate, couple of condoms (don&#x2019;t I wish), and a Kindle loaded up with the latest J.R. Ward steamy hot, seriously action-packed vampire novel. Tell anyone, and they will never find your body. </p> <p><b>LG:</b> Favorite food?<br> <b>D.D.:</b> I&#x2019;ve always been partial to Italian. Which my squadmate Phil, told Alex all about. Now, Alex claims to be a serious Italian cook--apparently his mother is a Capozzoli and they know their Bolognese. A little wine, a little homemade pasta, a little tiramisu. All I gotta do is pick up the phone, tell him a time and date...one phone call. How hard can that be? One little call.</p> <p><b>LG:</b> You drive that butch police car all day. What's your idea of a dream ride?<br> <b>D.D.:</b> Walking on a beach. No car, no pager, no shoes. Just me, the wind, the waves and the cry of the gulls. I&#x2019;d probably go nuts within minutes, but it would be nice to give peace a chance.</p> <p><b>LG:</b> Can you ever see yourself partnering successfully with another cop? Or are you the quintessential lone wolf?<br> <b>D.D.:</b> Excuse me, I love my squad and my squad loves me. Neil is one of the finest detectives around, plus better him than me viewing all the autopsies. And Phil--hey, family man, great wife, four kids, works in homicide to escape the violence. Gotta love Phil. They have my back and I have theirs. Life is good.</p> <p><b>LG:</b> I'm a woman traveling alone, staying in a hotel. What are your top three tips to keep me safe from psychos?<br> <b>D.D.:</b> Most hotel crimes have to do with property theft. Unfortunately, a guest walking in on a burglary, or a thief breaking in assuming the room&#x2019;s vacant only to find a guest present, can lead to violence. Thus, your best defense is to always use the deadbolt, and always advertise when you&#x2019;re &#x201c;home,&#x201d; so to speak. </p><ol><li> Bolt all locks anytime you&#x2019;re in the room and hang out the Do Not Disturb Sign</li> <li> Double-check door is closed and latched (failures happen more than you think)</li> <li> Try to avoid staying in rooms closest to the elevators and/or stairs--these rooms are more frequently targeted by thieves as the location allows for quick getaways.</li></ol><p></p> <p><b>LG:</b> Do you have any scars?<br> <b>D.D.:</b> Maybe, but you should see the other guy. Give as good as you get, that&#x2019;s always been my motto.</p> <p><b>LG:</b> What's the most you've ever spent on a pair of shoes? Describe! <br> <b>D.D.:</b> Silver sequined Jimmy Choos, on sale $500. Should never have bought them, but they&#x2019;re really pretty and when I wear them, I don&#x2019;t look like a cop, walk like a cop, or think like a cop. How does that commercial go...? Oh yeah, priceless.</p> <p><b>LG:</b> If you had to: dog or cat? <br> <b>D.D.:</b> No! Never! Don&#x2019;t even think it!</p> <p><b>LG:</b> Tell me something I don't know about you.<br> <b>D.D.:</b> I like mobiles. Don&#x2019;t ask me why. But there&#x2019;s something cool about looking up and watching the various shapes and colors slowly twist around. Sometimes, after a really bad day, I go home, close my eyes and create mobiles in my head--maybe one with bright origami animals, or another with silver geometric shapes. I let them go round and round, til finally I can sleep. Then when I wake up, I&#x2019;ll know something critical about the crime--a piece of the puzzle I missed the day before, a clue I&#x2019;d overlooked. I think it&#x2019;s from focusing on patterns. That&#x2019;s what crimes are, really--very violent patterns that a good detective must deconstruct, then rebuild in her head.</p> <p><b>LG:</b> Worst crime scene?<br> <b>D.D.:</b> The mummified remains of six girls on the grounds of the abandoned mental institute in Mattapan. Never saw anything like it, never want to again. Funny, that was Bobby Dodge&#x2019;s first case as a detective (<em>Hide</em>)--got him a wife, and now a baby girl. But he never talks about it, and neither do I. Sometimes, finding justice for the victims isn&#x2019;t enough, but it&#x2019;s all we got. So a good detective walls it up, puts a Do Not Disturb Sign on that section of memory and walks away. Gotta in this job, or you&#x2019;ll go mad.</p> <p><b>LG:</b> What do you wish you knew five years ago?<br> <b>D.D.:</b> Can a working woman have it all? Five years ago, I sweated my job. I worried I wasn&#x2019;t working smart enough, closing cases fast enough. Now, I sweat my entire life. Am I working too hard? Missing out on other parts of life? Maybe I should take Alex up on his offer of homemade alfredo, except can I really be the detective I need to be, while trying to be the girlfriend I&#x2019;d like to be? Can&#x2019;t figure it out. So I wish that I&#x2019;d realized five years ago, how good I had it. That focusing only on my policing career was a luxury I&#x2019;d never have again.

One of our most brilliant and original management thinkers, Mintzberg concludes that the term is an oxymoron -- that strategy cannot be planned because planning is about analysis and strategy is about synthesis. That is why, he asserts, the process has failed so often and so dramatically. <br> Mintzberg traces the origins and history of strategic planning through its prominence and subsequent fall. He argues that we must reconceive the process by which strategies are created -- by emphasizing informal learning and personal vision -- and the roles that can be played by planners. Mintzberg proposes new and unusual definitions of planning and strategy, and examines in novel and insightful ways the various models of strategic planning and the evidence of why they failed. Reviewing the so-called "pitfalls" of planning, he shows how the process itself can destroy commitment, narrow a company's vision, discourage change, and breed an atmosphere of politics. In a harsh critique of many sacred cows, he describes three basic fallacies of the process -- that discontinuities can be predicted, that strategists can be detached from the operations of the organization, and that the process of strategy-making itself can be formalized. <br> Mintzberg devotes a substantial section to the new role for planning, plans, and planners, not inside the strategy-making process, but in support of it, providing some of its inputs and sometimes programming its outputs as well as encouraging strategic thinking in general. This book is required reading for anyone in an organization who is influenced by the planning or the strategy-making processes.</p><p>Henry Mintzberg is the author of several seminal books, including <i>The Nature of Managerial Work</i>, <i>The Rise and Fall of Strategic Planning</i>, and <i>Managers Not MBAs</i>. He is Cleghorn Professor of Management Studies at McGill University.<b>Chapter 1: Planning and Strategy</b><br><br>What is the relationship between planning and strategy? Is strategy making simply a process of planning, as the proponents of planning have so vigorously insisted? Or, at the other extreme, is strategic planning simply another oxymoron, like progressive conservative or jumbo shrimp (or civil engineer?). In other words, should strategy always be planned, never be planned, or sometimes be planned? Or should it relate to planning in some other way?<br><br>Barely anything written about planning or strategy provides considered answers to these questions. This book seeks to do so. We begin in this chapter by addressing some other basic questions. First we ask, "What is planning anyway?" After considering a variety of popular answers, we narrow them down to a definition of our own. Next we ask, "Why plan?" and provide the answers according to planners. (Our own answers come later.) Finally we ask, "And what is strategy?" and answer in a way that is opposite to planning by insisting on the need for several definitions. Then, after considering briefly planning, plans, and planners, we conclude this opening chapter with the plan for the rest of the book.<br><br><b>What Is Planning Anyway?</b><br><br>This may seem like a strange question to ask as the twentieth century draws to a close, given the long popularity of planning, especially (ironically) in both Corporate America and Communist Europe. Largely a budget exercise in the America of the 1950s, it began to spread quickly, having become firmly installed in most large corporations by the mid-1960s (Gilmore, 1970:16; Chamberlain, 1968:151). At that point the notion of strategic planning took hold, to become within a decade a virtual obsession among American corporations (and in American government, in the form of the Planning-Programming-Budgeting System, or PPBS).<br><br>In fact, however, the concept dates much farther back. There is even a reference to a "Director of Strategic Planning" in Sun Tzu's <i>The Art of War</i> (1971:146), originally written about 2,400 years ago (although a Chinese student of mine considers this title too loose a translation from the Chinese). But there is no doubt about the translation of Henri Fayol's work. Writing of his experiences as a French mining chief executive in the last century, he noted the existence of "ten-yearly forecasts...revised every five years" (1949:47). Despite all this attention, the fact remains that the question, "What is planning anyway?", has never been properly answered -- indeed, seldom seriously addressed -- in planning's own literature.<br><br>In 1967, in what remains one of the few carefully reasoned articles on the subject, Loasby wrote that "the word 'planning' is currently used in so many and various senses that it is in some danger of degenerating into an emotive noise" (1967:300). At about the same time, one of the more impressive assemblages of planning people took place at Bellagio, Italy, (Jantsch, 1969) under the auspices of the OECD. Jay Forrester's "reflection" on the conference included the comment that "efforts to define the terms [planning and long-range forecasting] failed" (1969a:503). They have failed ever since.<br><br>Aaron Wildavsky, a political scientist well-known for his criticisms of planning, concluded that in trying to be everything, planning became nothing:<br><br>Planning protrudes in so many directions, the planner can no longer discern its shape. He may be economist, political scientist, sociologist, architect or scientist. Yet the essence of his calling-planning -- escapes him. He finds it everywhere in general and nowhere in particular. Why is planning so elusive? (1973:127)<br><br>"Planning" may be so elusive because its proponents have been more concerned with promoting vague ideals than achieving viable positions, more concerned with what planning might be than what it actually became. As a result, planning has lacked a clear definition of its own place in organizations and in the state. Yet it is our belief that planning has, nevertheless, carved out a viable niche for itself, through its own successes and failures. The need, therefore, is not to create a place for planning so much as to recognize the place it already does occupy.<br><br>This book seeks to describe that place with regard to strategy-in effect, to develop an <i>operational</i> definition of planning in the context of strategy making. But we do not begin with the assumption that planning is whatever people called planners happen to do, or that planning is any process that generates formal plans. People called planners can sometimes do strange things, just as strategies can sometimes result from strange processes. We need to delineate the word carefully if it is not to be eventually dropped from the management literature as hopelessly contaminated. We begin here by considering <i>formal</i> definitions of planning; the rest of this book is about the operational definition.<br><br>To some people <b>(1) planning is future thinking,</b> simply taking the future into account. "Planning denotes thinking about the future," wrote Bolan (1974:15). Or in the more poetic words of Sawyer, "Planning is action laid out in advance" (1983:1).<br><br>The problem with this definition is that it cannot be bounded. What organizational activity, no matter how short-term or reactive, does not take the future into account? Newman acknowledged the problem back in 1951 when he quoted Dennison that "Almost all work, in order to be done at all, must be planned, at the least informally and a few minutes ahead" (1951:56). By this definition, planning includes ordering a sandwich for lunch as much as establishing a division to flood the market with sandwiches. In fact, Fayol understood this breadth of the term back in 1916 when he wrote that:<br><br>The maxim, "managing means looking ahead," gives some idea of the importance attached to planning in the business world, and it is true that if foresight is not the whole of management at least it is an essential part of it. (1949:43, published in French in 1916)<br><br>But if this is true if, as Dror put it more baldly, "planning, in a word, is management" (1971:105) -- why bother to use the word "planning" when "management" works just fine?<br><br>To others, <b>(2) planning is controlling the future,</b> not just thinking about it but acting on it, or as Weick (1979) is fond of saying, enacting it. "Planning is the design of a desired future and of effective ways of bringing it about," Ackoff wrote (1970:1). Others expressed the same thought when they defined the purpose of planning as "to create controlled change in the environment" (Ozbekhan, 1969:152), or, more pointedly, "the design of social systems" (Forrester, 1969b:237). In this regard, John Kenneth Galbraith argued in his book, <i>The New Industrial State,</i> that big business engages in planning to "replace the market," to "exercise control over what is sold...[and] what is supplied" (1967:24).<br><br>But this second definition of planning, really just the other side of the coin from the first, suffers from the same problem of excessive breadth. By associating planning with free will, it becomes synonymous again with popular uses of the word management and so loses distinctive meaning.<br><br>Since practically all actions with future consequences are planned actions, planning is everything, and nonplanning can hardly be said to exist. Nonplanning only exists when people have no objectives, when their actions are random and not goal-directed. If everybody plans (well, almost) it is not possible to distinguish planned from unplanned actions. (Wildavsky, 1973:130)<br><br>Schumacher (1974) provides some conceptual help here. By distinguishing the past from the future, acts from events, and certainty from uncertainty, eight possible cases are constructed:<br><br><b>1.</b> act-past-certain<br><br><b>2.</b> act-future-certain<br><br><b>3.</b> act-past-uncertain<br><br><b>4.</b> act-future-uncertain<br><br><b>5.</b> event-past-certain<br><br><b>6.</b> event-future-certain<br><br><b>7.</b> event-past-uncertain<br><br><b>8.</b> event-future-uncertain (188-189)<br><br>This approach is used to clarify such words as "plan," "forecast," and "estimate," and we can use it here to help position planning. The first two definitions in the list appear to place planning in cases 2 and 4 -- how to act in the future, whether certain or uncertain, or how to make it certain by enacting it. Anything to do with events -- things that "simply happen" -- is outside of the realm of planning: "to apply the word 'planning' to matters outside the planner's control is absurd," although that can be a part of "forecasting" (189). Thus planning is precluded, for example, from cases 5 and 8, the given past and the uncertain, uncontrollable future, although the author noted the frequency with which case 8 forecasts are "presented as if they were plans" (189). Alternately, "'estimates' are put forward which upon inspection turn out to be plans" (190). As for the past (e.g., case 1), planning would hardly seem to have a role to play here, although, as we shall see near the end of this book, planners themselves may have roles in that studies of past behavior can influence future events (cases 2 and 4).<br><br>Still, we need a definition of planning that tells us not <i>that</i> we have to think about the future, not even that we should try to control it, but <i>how</i> these things are done. In other words, planning has to be defined by the <i>process</i> it represents. In this regard, a number of writers have proposed, sometimes inadvertently, that <b>(3) planning is decision making.</b> As far back as 1949, Goetz defined planning as "fundamentally choosing" (in Steiner, 1979:346), and in 1958 Koontz defined it as "the conscious determination of courses of action designed to accomplish purposes. Planning is, then, deciding" (1958:48). Likewise, Snyder and Glueck, without labeling it decision making, defined planning as "those activities which are concerned specifically with determining in advance what actions and/or human and physical resources are required to reach a goal. It includes identifying alternatives, analyzing each one, and selecting the best ones" (1980:73). Similarly, in certain literature of the public sector (so-called public planning), the term planning has been used as a virtual synonym for decision making and project management (see, for example, the various writings of Nutt [e.g., 1983, 1984]). Others tried to nuance this definition: Drucker, for example, by discussing the "futurity of present decisions" (1959:239), and Ozbekhan, by describing the "future directed decision process" (1969:151).<br><br>But unless anyone can think of a decision process that is not future-directed, these nuances are of little help. Assuming that decision means commitment to action (see Mintzberg, Raisinghani, and Th�or�t, 1976), every decision takes the future into consideration by a vow to act, whether it be to market a product in ten years or ship one in ten minutes. Rice recognized this when he argued that <i>"all</i> decisions are made with forethought," that every decision maker has "a reason for making his decision," which amounts to a "plan" (1983:60).<br><br>Thus, this third definition really reduces to the first and, because commitment is an act of free will, to the second as well. Accordingly, planning again becomes synonymous with everything managers do, "part of the intellectual process the policy maker employs to reach his decision," even if "informal, unstructured" (Cooper, 1975:229). In fact, to make their case that managers do indeed plan, Snyder and Glueck used the example of a school superintendent dealing with the efforts of a councilman to disrupt school board meetings and discredit him. But if planning is reacting to such pressures in the short term, then what isn't planning? Indeed, these authors quoted George (1972) that:<br><br><i>Planning,</i> of course, is not a separate, recognizable act....Every managerial act, mental or physical is inexorably intertwined with planning. It is as much a part of every managerial act as breathing is to the living human. (1980:75, italics in original)<br><br>But if that is true, why describe what organizations do as planning, any more than describe what people do as breathing? In other words, who needs the planning label when decision making or even managing does the job? As Sayles noted, planning (presumably by any of these first definitions) and decision making "are inextricably bound up in the warp and woof of the [manager's] interaction pattern, and it is a false abstraction to separate them" (1964:2087).<br><br>Let us, therefore, begin to consider more bounded definitions of planning as a process. <b>(4) Planning is integrated decision making.</b> To Schwendiman, it is an "integrated decision structure" (1973:32). To van Gunsteren, it "means fitting together of ongoing activities into a meaningful whole" (1976:2): "Planning implies getting somewhat more organized....It means making a feasible commitment around which already available courses of action get organized".<br><br>The last definition may seem close to the preceding one. But because it is concerned not so much with the making of decisions as with the conscious attempt to integrate different ones, it is fundamentally different and begins to identify a position for planning. Consider the words of Ackoff:<br><br>Planning is required when the future state that we desire involves a set of interdependent decisions; that is, a system of decisions....the principal complexity in planning derives from the interrelatedness of the decisions rather than from the decisions themselves....(1970:2, 3)<br><br>This view of planning finally takes us into the realm of strategy making, since that process also deals with the interrelationships among decisions (important ones) in an organization. But because this normally has to take place over time, such coordination among decisions is rendered difficult. Planning as integrated decision making imposes a particularly stringent requirement, however: that the decisions in question be batched -- be drawn together periodically into a single, tightly coupled process so that they can all be made (or at least approved) at a single point in time. As Ozbekhan noted of the result, "'Plan' refers to an integrative hierarchically organized action constraint in which various kinds of decisions are functionally ordered" (1969:153).<br><br>It is this requirement that may help to explain why planning is sometimes treated as synonymous with decision making. If different decisions have to be batched, they may come to resemble a single decision. Hence planning writers have tended to confuse decision making with strategy making by assuming that the latter necessarily involves the selection of a single course of action -- the choice of an integrated strategy at one point in time. Normann, in fact, made this point about Igor Ansoff's well-known writings on planning:<br><br>Ansoff regards the choice of strategy and the formulation of policy chiefly as a decision process: first, goals are established, after which (using a series of analytical techniques) alternatives are evolved and (still using analytical techniques) a choice made among them, possibly after some adjustments in the original goals. (1977:8-9)<br><br>But since, as we shall see, there are other ways in which to make strategy, notably dynamically <i>over</i> time, the process of integrating decisions at a point in time becomes, not strategy making, but simply <i>planning's approach</i> to strategy making, the situation to which it restricts <i>itself.</i> Thus its position becomes clearer. However, it is still not clear enough. Visionary leaders likewise integrate decisions, in their cases informally, or, if you prefe...</p><h2>REAL Science Odyssey, Biology 2 Teacher Guide</h2><p>RSO Biology 2 is a comprehensive biology course designed to meet and exceed the National Science Education Standards for life science at the middle school level (grades 5 through 8).

He lives in St. Paul, Minnesota.Edgar-winner Housewright nicely confounds readers' expectations in his absorbing seventh hard-boiled mystery featuring ex-cop and millionaire Rushmore McKenzie (after 2009's <i>Jelly's Gold</i>). After two men abduct McKenzie from his St. Anthony, Minn., home, and transport him to the small town of Libbie, S.D., McKenzie learns he's wanted for a scam that threatens Libbie's financial future. He's soon able to establish that a con man adopted his identity&#x2014;and agrees, instead of suing, to help attractive city council member Tracie Blake track down the grifter. McKenzie, who comes to believe that the criminal must have had help from the inside, begins to make enemies with his inquiries. In addition, he must fend off come-ons from several locals and solve a double murder that may be related to the imposter's plot.

In the century since her death she has become known and loved throughout the world. Abbe Combes, the author of several highly regarded studies on her, often spoke of her as &#x201c;the Universal Saint.&#x201d;<br><br>What accounts for such popularity? What makes so many--from scholars to the poorest of poor, from artists to monks--find inspiration in this woman who lived to only twenty-four years old? For me the answer is simple: She captures many hearts because she is so completely, warmly human. People relate to her experiences, which we know about in detail from her own writings and those of her contemporaries, especially her sisters. In her autobiography she reveals personal secrets, which few are so candid to admit. She tells us that she was powerfully drawn to God as a little child, but she also tells us about her struggles growing up and her painful adolescence. She was said to be a stubborn child and impatient, yet also reflective. In the twenty-four short years of her life she reached the heights of spiritual development while struggling not only with the darkest of spiritual nights but also with the physical pain of illness and the frustrations of living with a group of women. To know Therese is to understand that she is one of us. Within the parameters of her family life and then life in the convent, she is a saint within our reach.<br><br>In reading her account of her childhood, we learn that a good part of her early years was marked by an excessive sensitivity, which she did not overcome until she was thirteen years old. She showed uncommon courage in struggling with this tendency, but the problem persisted and wreaked havoc on her. She was much too easily hurt, often cried, blushed unaccountably, felt shy with strangers, and found it hard to compete with other children. Although she was very bright, she had to be taken out of school and placed with a tutor, lest the pressure prove too much for her and cause a nervous breakdown. She admits all this in her autobiography with disarming candor. Speaking of when she was thirteen, she writes:<br><br>I was really unbearable because of my extreme touchiness; if I happened to cause anyone I loved some little trouble, even unwittingly, instead of forgetting about it and not crying, which made matters worse, I cried like a Magdelene and then when I began to cheer up, I&#x2019;d begin to cry again for having cried. All arguments were useless; I was quite unable to correct this terrible fault. I really don&#x2019;t know how I could entertain the thought of entering Carmel [the convent] when I was still in the swaddling clothes of a child!<br><br>God would have to work a little miracle to make me grow up in an instant.1<br><br>What caused such behavior were the psychological wounds of maternal loss she experienced in childhood. When a child is very young, such a loss can shake his or her sense of security. Therese suffered this loss not once but five times. Although she grew up surrounded by love in a splendid family, a series of sudden separations left her at sea emotionally.<br><br>Therese was born into a deeply religious family. Her parents married late in life because they both first considered joining religious communities. Louis Martin felt drawn to the contemplative life and applied for admission to a Cistercian monastery in the Alps, but after serious deliberation he abandoned the idea and instead trained to become a watchmaker. Zelie Guerin, for her part, had an earnest wish to serve the poor in the Sisters of the H�tel Dieu in Alencon, but after lengthy discussions with their superior she reached the conclusion that she was meant for marriage and raising a family. She took up the art of hand making the famous lace of Alencon. When Louis and Zelie met, each was the owner of a small business--he of a prosperous jewelry shop in town and she of a thriving lacemaking enterprise in the same town.<br><br>The story of their first encounter is quite romantic. They met while crossing a bridge one morning on their way to work. They had seen each other before, but on this occasion their eyes lingered in mutual admiration. He arranged to be introduced to her formally, and within three months they were married. Clearly they were meant for each other, and their marriage became a remarkable success.<br><br>The Martins were the parents of nine children, three of whom died in infancy and one at the age of eight. The five remaining girls were Marie, Pauline, Leonie, Celine, and Therese. As the youngest of the siblings, Therese was also the darling of the family. She had joyous memories of her early childhood. Zelie&#x2019;s letters to her older daughters, who were at boarding school during much of this time, are filled with charming anecdotes about their baby sister. She was the prettiest of them all, the happy mother did not hesitate to report. She was gay and quick to learn, outgoing and affectionate, although with a mind of her own. She was &#x201c;the little imp&#x201d; and the joy of the family, her mother would say. Therese would recall these years fully appreciative of the love she received. &#x201c;God was pleased all through my life to surround me with love, and the first memories I have are stamped with smiles and the most tender caresses,&#x201d; she later wrote (Story, p. 17).<br>The Loss of Her Mother<br><br>When Therese was almost four, Zelie discovered she had breast cancer, and she died six months later. In her autobiography, Therese describes the family kneeling at her deathbed, her father bent over with his face in his hands, sobbing. She tells us that, surprisingly, she herself did not cry; nor did she cry when the coffin was brought in and placed outside her mother&#x2019;s bedroom door. She stood before it lost in thoughtful silence, knowing it would carry Mama&#x2019;s body away and she would never see her again. It was too much for tears for her. This once joyous and lively child was suddenly quiet and withdrawn. She was entering what she would later call the second period of her life, and the most painful. She became overly sensitive and shy, making her experience at school in a few years very difficult.<br><br>Therese&#x2019;s relationship with her sister Pauline was especially important at this time. When the family came home from the funeral the maid--with intended sympathy but little tact--said to her, &#x201c;Poor little things, you have no mother any more!&#x201d; Therese bounded into Pauline&#x2019;s arms and exclaimed: &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Pauline who will be my Mama!&#x201d; (Story, p. 34). The two at once formed a relationship that became very strong. Ten years older than Therese, Pauline in truth became her mother: said her prayers with her each day, got her dressed in the morning, supervised her education, and put her to bed at night, kissing her fondly as she fell asleep.<br><br>The two shared all their secrets. Pauline confided to her that she would one day enter the Carmelite convent on the other side of town. Therese had often passed it on walks and was full of questions about the nuns behind the walls. She told Pauline that she would enter too. Though she was only a child when she said this, she never doubted that her vocation could be traced back to her childhood, not simply to follow Pauline but because of her own desire to give her life to Jesus so totally.<br>The Loss of Pauline<br><br>When Therese was ten she was shocked to overhear Pauline telling Marie, the oldest in the family and now the manager of the household, that she was ready to enter Carmel and would do so very soon. This grievously wounded Therese, though she mentioned it to no one--least of all to Pauline. She kept it to herself for years until she wrote her autobiography when she was twenty-two, a book not written on her own initiative but under obedience to her prioress in the Carmel convent, who happened to be Pauline at the time. In her autobiography she remarked that what hurt her most was not Pauline&#x2019;s departure, but that she broke the news to Marie without first telling her. For a time there were feelings of estrangement from Pauline, which made Therese&#x2019;s second maternal loss more difficult to handle.<br><br>Not long after Pauline&#x2019;s departure, Therese had a serious breakdown, an indication of how deeply attached she was to her sister. She was bedridden for eight weeks. Her conduct became bizarre, and she suffered hallucinations. A nail on the wall became a serpent, her father&#x2019;s black hat an object of terror. She thrashed about wildly in bed and banged her head against the bedposts. Doctors were unable to diagnose this illness. Therese herself suspected diabolic possession, and later in life she spoke of what she felt was the devil&#x2019;s part in it. While it is not possible to be sure of the true nature of the sickness, it would be unwise to brush aside her suspicion, for she was extremely bright and psychologically perceptive. Whatever it was, Therese was no stranger to suffering, as we shall later see.<br><br>It came to the point that the family feared they would lose her, and they prayed desperately for her cure. The girls brought a statue of the Virgin Mary into her room and begged her for a miracle. Suddenly and mysteriously Therese was restored to health. Marie, who had assumed the role of mother after Pauline left for the cloister, was with her at the time and noticed that Therese was staring at the statue just as the cure occurred. Later she asked Therese what she had seen. Therese did not reply, but Marie persisted: &#x201c;Do tell me what you saw.&#x201d;<br><br>Reluctantly she answered that she had seen the Virgin smile and that her smile was &#x201c;ravishing.&#x201d; The words were hardly spoken when she regretted them, feeling she had no right to divulge what should have been left a secret. Marie told Pauline, who told the nuns in Carmel, and the story quickly traveled through Lisieux.<br><br>Therese was mortified, another example of her sensitivity. First she blamed herself for revealing what she felt she should have kept to herself. Then she began to question whether she actually saw the Virgin smile. Finally she wondered if she had invented the entire episode: the cure and even the illness itself, just to get attention for herself. Could the whole experience have been a figment of her imagination? How complex her mind was at the age of ten, and how prone she was to question the existence of a miracle! She lived with this state of perplexity for four years until, while visiting the Church of Notre-Dame des Victoires, she became sure that the Virgin had smiled at her and her illness had not been some sort of unconscious ruse. As she prayed in this church before the statue, the doubt quietly went away and never came back.<br>The Loss of Marie<br><br>Further trials were in store for Therese. At the age of twelve, a critical time for a growing girl, she developed a case of scrupulosity, a not uncommon anxiety neurosis that afflicts a person with feelings of guilt about things that do not reflect any wrongdoing or sin on his or her part. In Therese&#x2019;s case the scruples had to do with sexual images, which kept invading her imagination the more she tried to dispel them. In all simplicity she revealed them to her confidante, Marie, who dismissed them as nonsense. The advice pacified her troubled conscience, but only temporarily. She kept coming back to Marie with the same worry--seesawing is a typical feature of scruples.<br><br>In the midst of this crisis, Marie, who was the last person anyone would think would enter a convent, felt called by God to Carmel. She did not for a moment question the call, and she did not delay in answering it. Within a few weeks she joined Pauline in Carmel, where she played a very important role in the mission of Therese.<br><br>Once again Therese was devastated by maternal loss, left with no one in whom she could confide her delicate dilemma. Her scruples persisted, and she turned in desperation to her four little brothers and sisters who had died when their lives had hardly begun. She reminded them that she was their youngest sister and she had no one else to help her. She pleaded for their help. Shortly thereafter, without anything dramatic occurring, the scruples quietly disappeared, although her sensitivity would continue to afflict her, as she later would write. It should now be clear that maternal loss was at the root of Therese&#x2019;s adolescent feelings of insecurity. But a question inevitably arises. Why was Therese so vulnerable to maternal loss that the death of her mother created serious psychological problems that would take ten years to resolve? Others might suffer a similar crisis when they were young without sustaining the damage Therese did. Was there something in her background that made her more vulnerable than the average child?<br><br>The Very First Loss<br><br>In fact, there was something that made Therese vulnerable to maternal loss, and what it was has not received the attention it deserves. The death of her mother was not her first maternal loss. She had experienced a painful separation twice in her early infancy.<br><br>When Therese was only three months old she developed serious pulmonary difficulties, which left her struggling for breath and wheezing alarmingly. Her parents were terrified that they would lose her as they had already lost four young children. The family doctor said their fear was well founded. Alencon was a smoky city, and what the baby needed if she was to survive was to be out in the country air for an extended time, in order to give her lungs a chance to heal and recover fully. He urged Louis and Zelie to send her away.<br><br>There was a woman named Rose Taille, a farmer&#x2019;s wife in Semalle, six miles from where the Martins lived. Therese could stay with her. Once before, Rose had been helpful when Joseph Martin was ailing as a baby. Regrettably he died, but the Martins knew that this was not because of any neglect on Rose&#x2019;s part. She had done everything possible to nurse him back to health and was heartbroken when he died. Rose had recently given birth to a baby boy, and she would be able to nurse Therese.<br><br>The difficult decision was taken, and Therese was brought to Semalle. That was her first maternal separation, and its devastating impact must not be underestimated. It is hard to measure the effect on a three-month-old child who is taken from her mother&#x2019;s arms and given to a stranger, in a place she has never seen. There was a time when we might have thought that she was only a baby and babies get over shocks like these--they don&#x2019;t even remember them. But we know better now. The shock (we refer to it as trauma today) does not go away. It remains hidden in the psyche, much to the detriment of the child.<br>1 Story of a Soul: The Autobiography of St. Th�r�se of Lisieux, 3rd ed., trans.

James Bond is dedicated to the destruction of its agents wherever he finds them. Then the cold eye of SMERSH focuses on Bond and far away in Moscow a trap is laid for him.</p><p>Born in 1908 and educated at Eton and Sandhurst, Fleming joined Reuters News Agency in 1931. During WW2 he was Personal Assistant to the Director of Naval Intelligence at the Admiralty, rising from the rank of Lieutenant to Commander. He built his house, Goldeneye (where he wrote his first Bond novel), in Jamaica when he became Foreign Manager of Kemsley Newspapers. By the time of his death in 1964, he had sold over forty million books, and the cult of Bond was internationally established.<b>1. ROSELAND</b> <p>The naked man who lay splayed out on his face beside the swimming pool might have been dead.</p> <p>He might have been drowned and fished out of the pool and laid out on the grass to dry while the police or the next-of-kin were summoned. Even the little pile of objects in the grass beside his head might have been his personal effects, meticulously assembled in full view so that no one should think that something had been stolen by his rescuers.</p> <p>To judge by the glittering pile, this had been, or was, a rich man. It contained the typical membership badges of the rich man's club - a money clip, made of a Mexican fifty-dollar piece and holding a substantial wad of banknotes, a well-used gold Dunhill lighter, an oval gold cigarette case with the wavy ridges and discreet turquoise button that means Faberge, and the sort of novel a rich man pulls out of the bookcase to take into the garden - The Little Nugget - an old P.G. Wodehouse. There was also a bulky gold wristwatch on a well-used brown crocodile strap. It was a Girard-Perregaux model designed for people who like gadgets, and it had a sweep second-hand and two little windows in the face to tell the day of the month, and the month, and the phase of the moon. The story it now told was 2.30 on June 10th with the moon three-quarters full.</p> <p>A blue and green dragon-fly flashed out from among the rose bushes at the end of the garden and hovered in mid-air a few inches above the base of the man's spine. It had been attracted by the golden shimmer of the June sunshine on the ridge of fine blond hairs above the coccyx. A puff of breeze came off the sea. The tiny field of hairs bent gently. The dragonfly darted nervously sideways and hung above the man's left shoulder, looking down. The young grass below the man's open mouth stirred. A large drop of sweat rolled down the side of the fleshy nose and dropped glittering into the grass. That was enough. The dragonfly flashed away through the roses and over the jagged glass on top of the high garden wall. It might be good food, but it moved.</p> <p>The garden in which the man lay was about an acre of well-kept lawn surrounded on three sides by thickly banked rose bushes from which came the steady murmur of bees. Behind the drowsy noise of the bees the sea boomed softly at the bottom of the cliff at the end of the garden.</p> <p>There was no view of the sea from the garden - no view of anything except of the sky and the clouds above the twelve-foot wall. In fact you could only see out of the property from the two upstairs bedrooms of the villa that formed the fourth side of this very private enclosure. From them you could see a great expanse of blue water in front of you and, on either side, the upper windows of neighbouring villas and the tops of the trees in their gardens - Mediterranean-type evergreen oaks, stone pines, casuarinas and an occasional palm tree.</p> <p>The villa was modern - a squat elongated box without ornament. On the garden side the flat pink-washed facade was pierced by four iron-framed windows and by a central glass door leading on to a small square of pale green glazed tiles. The tiles merged into the lawn. The other side of the villa, standing back a few yards from a dusty road, was almost identical. But on this side the four windows were barred, and the central door was of oak.</p> <p>The villa had two medium-sized bedrooms on the upper floor and on the ground floor a sitting-room and a kitchen, part of which was walled off into a lavatory. There was no bathroom.</p> <p>The drowsy luxurious silence of early afternoon was broken by the sound of a car coming down the road. It stopped in front of the villa. There was the tinny clang of a car door being slammed and the car drove on. The doorbell rang twice. The naked man beside the swimming pool did not move, but, at the noise of the bell and of the departing car, his eyes had for an instant opened very wide. It was as if the eyelids had pricked up like an animal's ears. The man immediately remembered where he was and the day of the week and the time of the day. The noises were identified. The eyelids with their fringe of short sandy eyelashes drooped drowsily back over the very pale blue, opaque, inward-looking eyes. The small cruel lips opened in a wide jaw-breaking yawn which brought saliva into the mouth. The man spat the saliva into the grass and waited.</p> <p>A young woman carrying a small string bag and dressed in a white cotton shirt and a short, unalluring blue skirt came through the glass door and strode mannishly across the glazed tiles and the stretch of lawn towards the naked man. A few yards away from him, she dropped her string bag on the grass and sat down and took off her cheap and rather dusty shoes. Then she stood up and unbuttoned her shirt and took it off and put it, neatly folded, beside the string bag.</p> <p>The girl had nothing on under the shirt. Her skin was pleasantly sunburned and her shoulders and fine breasts shone with health. When she bent her arms to undo the side-buttons of her skirt, small tufts of fair hair showed in her armpits. The impression of a healthy animal peasant girl was heightened by the chunky hips in faded blue stockinet bathing trunks and the thick short thighs and legs that were revealed when she had stripped.</p> <p>The girl put the skirt neatly beside her shirt, opened the string bag, took out an old soda-water bottle containing some heavy colourless liquid and went over to the man and knelt on the grass beside him. She poured some of the liquid, a light olive oil, scented, as was everything in that part of the world, with roses, between his shoulder blades and, after flexing her fingers like a pianist, began massaging the sternomastoid and the trapezius muscles at the back of the man's neck.</p> <p>It was hard work. The man was immensely strong and the bulging muscles at the base of the neck hardly yielded to the girl's thumbs even when the downward weight of her shoulders was behind them. By the time she was finished with the man she would be soaked in perspiration and so utterly exhausted that she would fall into the swimming pool and then lie down in the shade and sleep until the car came for her. But that wasn't what she minded as her hands worked automatically on across the man's back. It was her instinctive horror for the finest body she had ever seen.</p> <p>None of this horror showed in the flat, impassive face of the masseuse, and the upward-slanting black eyes under the fringe of short coarse black hair were as empty as oil slicks, but inside her the animal whimpered and cringed and her pulse-rate, if it had occurred to her to take it, would have been high.</p> <p>Once again, as so often over the past two years, she wondered why she loathed this splendid body, and once again she vaguely tried to analyse her revulsion. Perhaps this time she would get rid of feelings which she felt guiltily certain were much more unprofessional than the sexual desire some of her patients awoke in her.</p> <p>To take the small things first: his hair. She looked down at the round, smallish head on the sinewy neck. It was covered with tight red-gold curls that should have reminded her pleasantly of the formalised hair in the pictures she had seen of classical statues. But the curls were somehow too tight, too thickly pressed against each other and against the skull. They set her teeth on edge like fingernails against pile carpet. And the golden curls came down so low into the back of the neck - almost (she thought in professional terms) to the fifth cervical vertebra. And there they stopped abruptly in a straight line of small stiff golden hairs.</p> <p>The girl paused to give her hands a rest and sat back on her haunches. The beautiful upper half of her body was already shining with sweat. She wiped the back of her forearm across her forehead and reached for the bottle of oil. She poured about a tablespoonful on to the small furry plateau at the base of the man's spine, flexed her fingers and bent forward again.</p> <p>This embryo tail of golden down above the cleft of the buttocks - in a lover it would have been gay, exciting, but on this man it was somehow bestial. No, reptilian. But snakes had no hair. Well, she couldn't help that. It seemed reptilian to her. She shifted her hands on down to the two mounds of the gluteal muscles. Now was the time when many of her patients, particularly the young ones on the football team, would start joking with her. Then, if she was not very careful, the suggestions would come. Sometimes she could silence these by digging sharply down towards the sciatic nerve. At other times, and particularly if she found the man attractive, there would be giggling arguments, a brief wrestling-match and a quick, delicious surrender.</p> <p>With this man it was different, almost uncannily different. From the very first he had been like a lump of inanimate meat. In two years he had never said a word to her. When she had done his back and it was time for him to turn over, neither his eyes nor his body had once shown the smallest interest in her. When she tapped his shoulder, he would just roll over and gaze at the sky through half-closed lids and occasionally let out one of the long shuddering yawns that were the only sign that he had human reactions at all.</p> <p>The girl shifted her position and slowly worked down the right leg towards the Achilles tendon. When she came to it, she looked back up the fine body. Was her revulsion only physical? Was it the reddish colour of the sunburn on the naturally milk-white skin, the sort of roast meat look? Was it the texture of the skin itself, the deep, widely spaced pores in the satiny surface? The thickly scattered orange freckles on the shoulders? Or was it the sexuality of the man? The indifference of these splendid, insolently bulging muscles? Or was it spiritual - an animal instinct telling her that inside this wonderful body there was an evil person?</p> <p>The masseuse got to her feet and stood, twisting her head slowly from side to side and flexing her shoulders. She stretched her arms out s...</p></p><h2>The Forgotten (Animorphs #11)</h2><p>Discovering a crashed Yeerk Bug fighter, Tobias quickly alerts the Animorphs so that they can use the fighter to prove that the earth has been invaded, but the Yeerks retaliate by transporting the Animorphs to another time.

I had tumbled into bed later than I should have after a desperate attempt at putting my house in order. As a pregnant mother of three sons, I slept deeply in those days. I would shut my eyes and fall right to sleep, only to be roused by the sound of an alarm, children, or late-morning sunlight streaming into my room. But this night I fell asleep and woke at dawn, shaken to my core.<br><br>In the predawn hours I&#x2019;d experienced a vivid and unusual dream. Actually, to call it a dream makes it sound as though it came to me in the form of sleep or shadow; this imagery did not. I dream regularly, but not at this level of intensity. In my world of sleep, I found myself vibrantly awake. Before me was a scene set in another place and time. I sensed I no longer walked the pathways of earth. I stood in some heavenly realm, a place of illumination, without glare.<br><br>Radiant light was everywhere and appeared to come from everything. There was no mist or shadow, only glorious color. These saturated hues of living color were comprised of shades so concentrated that I am without earthly reference to name them. The pigments were layered and multidimensional. For some reason I best remember the tones of purple (but not quite our purple) and blue (yet unlike ours). There were no edges, sides, or upper border, yet the backdrop of color enwrapped what it showcased&#x2014;an elevated platform of flawless, cream-colored stone, and on this platform reclined a golden lioness.<br>She was feline perfection&#x2014;majestic, powerful, and richly textured. She didn&#x2019;t move, but there was no doubt in my mind that she was alive&#x2014;far more alive than any earthbound animal I&#x2019;d seen in motion. Her head was erect but not tense, and her forelegs stretched out in front of her. Her fur and eyes gleamed golden. Beneath her flawless, tawny coat, I could see every curve of her perfectly formed muscles. This stunning, still lioness was far more substantial, vivid, and vibrant than any of the lionesses that now walk our earth. I couldn&#x2019;t help thinking I beheld a heavenly prototype. Etched on the front of the flawless pillar platform were both a word and a roman numeral: Numbers XXIII.<br><br>In contrast with this lioness, my form felt transparent, insignificant, and strangely out of place. I felt detached from my body and unaware of being pregnant. I knew I was there <i>to behold and see, </i>to keenly observe&#x2014;and in doing so, to learn something unrealized. I sensed an urgency to grasp the weight of the imagery. Even though I was alone with a lioness, I felt no alarm or threat. I felt only wide-eyed wonder, as though by seeing, my spirit was being enlarged and connected. I absorbed all I could of what was around me. My focus shifted, and I looked into the eyes of the lioness. <br><br>As I did, I heard a voice somewhere behind me announce: <i>With the birth of this son,</i> <i>you will awaken a lioness.</i><br>In a blur of golden light, majesty, and wonder, it was over. The next thing I knew, it was morning, and I was fully awake. All my senses were in a state of high alert, not out of fear as much as out of shock. What had I just witnessed? As time has passed, I have come to believe our earth is the time tethered, shadowed form or partial revelation of what is original, timeless, and whole in heaven.<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br><b>RISE UP LIKE A LIONESS</b><br>As I lay in the gray of dawn, wide awake, heart racing, and body trembling, I sensed God had sent me this vision of a lioness to reveal something I would have easily missed in the day-to-day. He had my full attention. I was listening with every sense engaged. My room seemed faded and hollow, a stark contrast to the world of color I&#x2019;d just left. The morning sounds of earth were muffled compared to the clarion voice in the otherworldly place. I paused, afraid to move and lose the last remnants of the vision. I closed my eyes. Yes, it was all there&#x2014;the lioness, the platform, the inscription, the backdrop, and the voice.<br><br>Time passed, my heart slowed, my body calmed, and I opened my eyes. Curious about the inscription on the front of the platform, I reached out and drew my Bible into bed with me. I wondered, was there a connection with a literal chapter or verse? If so, what did Numbers 23 hold? As I flipped through the pages, my heart sank when I noted the translator&#x2019;s heading and discovered the passage was an oracle of Balaam. I knew he was an accurate, but dishonorable, prophet. I read on, not sensing much of anything until I came to verse 19.<br><br>&#x201c;God is not a man, so he does not lie. <br>He is not human, so he does not change his mind.<br>Has he ever spoken and failed to act?<br>Has he ever promised and not carried it through?<br>Listen, I received a command to bless;<br>God has blessed, and I cannot reverse it!<br>No misfortune is in his plan for Jacob;<br>no trouble is in store for Israel.<br>For the LORD their God is with them;<br>he has been proclaimed their king.<br>God brought them out of Egypt;<br>for them he is as strong as a wild ox.<br>No curse can touch Jacob;<br>no magic has any power against Israel.<br>For now it will be said of Jacob,<br>&#x201c;What wonders God has done for Israel!&#x201d; (Numbers 23:19&#x2013;23, NLT)<br>&nbsp;<br>These words contain so much about the faithfulness of God. His promises are sure and certain, and his blessings are irreversible. Because of God&#x2019;s faithfulness, Israel had a future secure and free from the tainted and twisted effects of witchcraft or curses. All this was reassuring, but the next verse was riveting. <br>&nbsp;<br><i>These people rise up like a lioness,</i> <i>like a majestic lion rousing itself. </i>They refuse to rest until they have feasted on prey, drinking the blood of the slaughtered! (Numbers 23:24, NLT)<br>&nbsp;<br>Trembling, I reread the fierce words printed on the fragile page: <i>rise up</i><br><i>like a lioness, like a majestic lion rousing itself. </i>The raw imagery hit me. I could<br>see it: a lion and his lioness, rising up out of the grass. As they rose, the dynamics of the plain changed from peaceful to electric. Every living creature sensed the lions&#x2019; change of posture and watched attentively. The golden ones were awake, stretching, testing the air, surveying their domain, ready to make their move. Perhaps they were hungry. Maybe they were agitated by the presence of an enemy who had violated the marked boundaries of their territory, and it was time to make their presence known.<br><br>Once they were up, tensions would be high until their movements ceased. If the lions were restless, there&#x2019;d be no rest for the other creatures until the lions had fought or feasted, then resettled. With their rising, I sensed a stirring of their strength in my spirit as well. Who isn&#x2019;t awed and captivated when a lion or lioness rises and moves out from its resting place? It is a wonder to behold. But what was this to me? How could I possibly be connected to any of this wild, golden might? While the imagery thrilled me, it also repelled me. I liked the idea of lionesses napping in the sun as their young frolicked, but images of the hunt and kill frightened and even disgusted me. When I watched <i>National Geographic</i> or <i>Wild Kingdom, </i>I averted my eyes as the big cats took down impalas and zebras. As these thoughts flashed through my mind, I recalled the words of the night vision: &#x201c;With the birth of this son, you will awaken a lioness.&#x201d; What could this mean? I saw no connection between the powerful, fearless lioness and the large, pregnant woman who lay in my bed. To say I was a lioness was laughable. I was a tofu-eating, borderline vegan, not a bloodthirsty predator. I was terrified by almost everything outside my control and intimidated by the majority of the people I met. I found strong, dominant women especially frightening.<br><br>My pregnancy had been somewhat of a reprieve. In an impassioned moment of prayer a few months before my son&#x2019;s conception, I&#x2019;d laid aside all my protests and told God, &#x201c;Okay, okay! I&#x2019;m yours. Have your way in my life! I&#x2019;ll do anything you want. I&#x2019;ll even talk to women if you want me to.&#x201d; Though at the time I had no idea what I might say. When I became pregnant, I figured all bets were off. I imagined the commission and my compliance had been a test of sorts&#x2014;like Abraham&#x2019;s willingness to sacrifice his son Isaac. Perhaps I&#x2019;d get bonus points for being willing and I&#x2019;d never have to follow through on my pledge. But with this vision, it appeared my pre-pregnancy deal still stood. And what was this about a son?<br><br>Throughout my pregnancy I&#x2019;d assumed I was carrying a daughter. Everyone I came in contact with told me I was having a girl. No one had mentioned the possibility of a boy. I was the only one who harbored the secret hope for another son. I shook my head in disbelief. <i>If </i>any of this was true and I was about to morph into a lioness of sorts, then surely someone else would see this impending transformation as well. This vision was going to require some serious secondary confirmation. <br>&nbsp;<br><b>LOOKING FOR AFFIRMATION</b><br>A few weeks passed, and a woman evangelist I had immense respect for came into town. Here was my chance! She&#x2019;d invited another pregnant friend and me to join her for lunch.

There simply comes a time in our lives&#x2014;not fundamentally different from the way puberty separates childhood from adulthood&#x2014;when it&#x2019;s time for one part of ourselves to die and for something new to be born.The purpose of this book by best-selling author and lecturer&nbsp;<b>Marianne Williamson</b>&nbsp;is to psychologically and spiritually reframe this transition so that it leads to a wonderful sense of joy and awakening.In our ability to rethink our lives lies our greatest power to change them. What we have called &#x201c;middle age&#x201d; need not be seen as a turning point toward death. It can be viewed as a magical turning point toward life as we&#x2019;ve never known it, if we allow ourselves the power of an independent imagination&#x2014;thought-forms that don&#x2019;t flow in a perfunctory manner from ancient assumptions merely handed down to us, but rather flower into new archetypal images of a humanity just getting started at 45 or 50.What we&#x2019;ve learned by that time, from both our failures as well as our successes, tends to have humbled us into purity. When we were young, we had energy but we were clueless about what to do with it. Today, we have less energy, perhaps, but we have far more understanding of what each breath of life is for. And now at last, we have a destiny to fulfill&#x2014;not a destiny of a life that&#x2019;s simply over, but rather a destiny of a life that is finally truly lived.Midlife is not a crisis; it&#x2019;s a time of rebirth. It&#x2019;s not a time to accept your death; it&#x2019;s a time to accept your&nbsp;<i>life</i>&#x2014;and to finally, truly live it, as you and you alone know deep in your heart it was meant to be lived.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Marianne Williamson</b> is an internationally acclaimed lecturer and the best-selling author of<i> A Return to Love, The Healing of America, A Woman&#x2019;s Worth,&nbsp;</i>and<i> Illuminata,</i>&nbsp;among other works.

Safety, a major concern with open flames near tissue paper and polyethylene, gets a full chapter plus frequent reminders. A closing section covers troubleshooting and repair information. Explanations of the science, which is meaty, are woven throughout the hands-on sections. Readers ready to begin will find detailed plans for eight different styles of hot-air balloons nicely bolded in the table of contents. Optional improvements and extensions are included with many plans. The directions are clear, detailed, numbered, and accompanied by meticulous line drawings. Occasional photos show a completed project or a special feature. Now and then, the instructions make reference to a feature, e.g., the cotton ball burner and lift, which are not explained until a later project. There is no index to help overcome this shortfall. Instructions also reference techniques that are not included, e.g., making a weld or working around pieces wrongly glued together. Other than these few problems, beginner through advanced hobbyists will find something to enjoy here. Hot-air ballooning is certain to have new devotees with this introduction.&#x2013;Carol S.

When he first sketched out his brilliant Gaia theory in the 1970s, people around the world embraced it; within a short time Gaia has moved from the margins of scientific research to the mainstream. James Lovelock argues that such things as the level of oxygen, the formation of clouds, and the saltiness of the oceans may all be controlled by interacting physical, chemical, and biological processes. He believes that &#34;the self-regulation of climate and chemical composition is a process that emerges from the tightly coupled evolution of rocks, air, and ocean - in addition to that of organisms. Such interlocking self-regulation, while rarely optimal - consider the cold and hot places of the earth, the wet and the dry - nevertheless keeps the Earth a fit place for life&#34;. The New York Times Book Review has called his arguments in favor of Gaia &#34;plausible and above all illuminating&#34;. Now, in an updated paperback edition, fully revised, the author amplifies his account of how Gaia works with descriptions of new fields of research that have been opened by this pathbreaking concept.James Lovelock is an independent scientist, inventor, and author. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1974 and in 1990 was awarded the first Amsterdam Prize for the Environment by the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. One of his inventions is the electron capture detector, which was important in the development of environmental awareness. It revealed for the first time the ubiquitous distribution of pesticide residues. He co-operated with NASA and some of his inventions were adopted in their program of planetary exploration.</p><h2>Clone Wars Adventures, Vol. 2 (Star Wars)</h2><p>In the rolling asteroid rings above a remote planet, General Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker play a deadly game of cat and mouse against Separatist droid fighters - and a squadron of highly skilled human pilots who have pledged their guns to Count Dooku.

Using the differences between cats and dogs in a light-handed manner, the authors challenge this thinking in deep and profound ways. This life-changing book will provide a new perspective and vision for God as we delight in the God who delights in us.</p><p>Dr. Gerald Robison and Bob Sjogren teach seminars on &#39;Cat and Dog Theology&#39; worldwide.The theme of this book is based on the notable differences between what may be two of mankind's (if not God's) favorite creatures: cats and dogs. <p>Knowing that there are animal lovers of each, we hope that no one takes offense to our acknowledging the different traits of these beloved creatures, for certainly no offense is intended. Rather, we merely recognize that cats' and dogs' God-given traits can be similar to certain theological attitudes held by many Christians. </p><p>In life, these attitudes are suitable in both felines and canines. But in our theology, some attitudes may draw us closer to God, and others can actually pull us away from Him. </p><p>We hope you learn to differentiate these attitudes!</p></p><h2>Eight Ways to Keep the Devil Under Your Feet</h2><p>Learn to Manage the Devil Instead of Letting Him Manage You There are all kinds of things that tempt us, hurt us, and confuse us.

McLaren<br> <br> This collection of Buechner&#x2019;s many sermons delivered throughout his lifetime is organized chronologically to reveal the development of his theology and thinking. Culled from great works such as The Magnificent Defeat, The Clown in the Belfry, A Room Called Remember, The Hungering Dark, and The Longing for Home, this collection also includes a new introduction and several new, previously unpublished sermons. It is through Buechner&#x2019;s sermons that we glimpse his genius most closely, and these reflections from one of today&#x2019;s best writers, thinkers, and preachers will inspire laughter, hope, and great peace.Frederick Buechner, author of more than thirty works of fiction and non-fiction, is an ordained Presbyterian minister.

He looks like a strapping young James Dean, with rippled abdominal muscles and defined--but not creepily large--quads, pecs, and biceps. He could pass for 30, but he was almost 60 years old when the photo was taken. <p> Pilates (Pi-LAH-teez) started an exercise program called Contrology, a low-impact series of hundreds of exercises designed to maximize abdominal strength while toning and increasing flexibility in the rest of the body. Once used primarily by professional ballet companies, the Pilates Method is now taught in major cities in 17 countries and is considered to be the world's fastest growing exercise program. Enthusiasts swear that for little effort--you're not very likely to break a sweat during class--the muscle-toning benefits are outstanding. The Pilates Method is especially useful for many people for relieving chronic back and joint pain. Some famous heavenly bodies rely on the Method, including newly buff Leonardo DiCaprio, Madonna, Julia Roberts, Jessica Lange, and Sharon Stone. Dancers Martha Graham and George Balanchine were also devotees.</p><p> <i>The Pilates Method of Body Conditioning</i> was cowritten by Romana Kryzanowska, the last living disciple of Joseph Pilates. With more than 300 step-by-step photos of 70 exercises, it's a solid and safe introduction to the core exercises of the program. Most can be performed on an exercise mat, but some require special Pilates equipment, such as resistance springs, which can be ordered from the resources in the back of the book. If you'd rather not make the financial investment in the equipment, you'll still very much appreciate the dozens of pointers on posture, technique, and breathwork for use during classes. <i>--Erica Jorgensen</i></p>Shortly after World War I, Joseph Pilates, an accomplished nurse, gymnast, skier, and boxer, perfected a rehabilitation and conditioning program of "Balanced Body" exercise by combining both Eastern and Western philosophies. For almost 70 years his low-stress program, which concentrates on proper breathing, body alignment, and improved concentration, was used primarily by performing artists and athletes, but it is now becoming popular with the general public because it provides a no-impact workout appropriate for all fitness levels from the sedentary intellectual to the professional dancer. The Pilates Method can also be used safely by pregnant women and seniors. Gallagher, founder of the worldwide chain of Pilates Studios and professional physical therapist for ballet companies, and Kryzanowska, a master trainer and personal friend of Pilates, have compiled a comprehensive resource that details more than 70 exercises with over 300 photos. A section on frequently asked questions, a summary of core exercises, a glossary, weekly exercise plans, web sites, lists of certifying centers and certified instructors, and a "how to" list for purchasing equipment all add to the value of this excellent handbook.

Here, Streep weaves the story behind Howell-Sickles&#39; vision of the cowgirl and places her in the context of world mythologies. The result is a celebration of the courage, self-reliance and exuberance of the cowgirl spirit, and indeed of the female spirit today. 120+ full-color paintings.</p><p>Donna Howell-Sickles was born in 1949 in Gainesville, Texas and raised on a 900 acre farm. In 1972, while earning her BFA at Texas Tech in Lubbock, she acquired an old postcard c. 1935 depicting a cowgirl seated on a horse which read, &#x201c;Greetings from a Real Cowgirl from the Ole Southwest.&#x201d; Attracted by the charm and confidence of the woman in the image, she began incorporating the cowgirl figure into her work, as well as collecting and researching these old-time cowgirl images. Before long, this icon was the central theme in the contemporary settings of Donna&#x2019;s pieces. Donna&#x2019;s works are largely mixed-media. She works on paper and canvas in a mix of charcoal, pastel and acrylic most often leaving her under-drawing visible. In Donna&#x2019;s pieces, the cowgirl achieves the status of a heroine, and her images have brought her national attention and success. Her work is rich with symbolism and allusions to classical mythology, but the viewer does not need to be familiar with the references in order to appreciate the female affirmations of each piece. Her paintings can be found in museum collections throughout the west including the Booth Western Art Museum in Cartersville, Texas; The National Cowgirl Hall of Fame in Fort Worth, Texas; The Buffalo Bill Historical Center, Cody Wyoming and several others.&nbsp;</p><h2>Puritans</h2><p>What did the Puritans and their successors teach? Was their teaching biblical? What can we learn from them for our life and witness today? These questions guided Dr. LLoyd-Jones in giving the addresses in this volume. Far from sharing the idea that a knowledge of the past is useless or irrelevant, he believed that the study of history is vital to the well-being of the church today. In these addresses given at the Puritan Studies and Westminster Conferences between 1959 and 1978, Dr. LLoyd-jones ranges widely over the history of Reformed Christianity from the Reformation to the nineteenth century, drawing lessons from major figures like Calvin and Knox, Bunyan and Owen, Edwards and Whitefield, and from lesser-known men such as Henry Jacob, John Glas and Robert Sandeman. Written in an absorbing and stimulating style, these studies continue to speak with great insight and relevance to the church of the twenty-first century.</p><p></p><h2>Women Poets, The Penguin Book of</h2><p>Arranges the poetic work of over three thousand five hundred years into historical and cultural traditions and gives a brief biographical note on each poet</p><p></p><h2>Saint Paul: Called to Conversion: A Seven-day Retreat</h2><p>"Saint Paul is the most prominent personality of the New Testament, apart from Jesus himself.

In the aftermath, Alabama coach Nick Saban and his football team went out into the community, sharing its grief and aiding in the recovery.

Long snapper Carson Tinker, who endured terrible personal tragedy in the storm, emerged as the public face of Tuscaloosa's resilience.

Applying to graduate school can be quite the challenge for any student, but it can seem particularly intimidating if you are one of the many students that do not have spectacular grades. Although grades are an important component of your application, grades alone will certainly not get you a free pass into the graduate school or program of your choice. There are many other important factors that no one tells you about, ones that can make or break an application. If you take the time to learn about and understand why you are being evaluated in a variety of ways in the first place, you can then use this to your advantage. This book will take you through, in a clear, step-by-step fashion, all of the measures that you will be evaluated upon and how you can take advantage of each one of them to come out ahead of the competition.</p><p>Dave G. Mumby, Ph.D. obtained his Ph.D. from the University of British Columbia. He is currently an Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology at Concordia University and a member of the Center for Studies in Behavioural Neurobiology (CSBN) Dr. Mumby supervises graduate students and has served on graduate admissions committees at Concordia University. He is also an academic advisor for the Psychology Department and holds frequent workshops on graduate school and the application process. Dr. Mumby s research area includes the functional neuroanatomy of memory systems, and cognitive impairments in a rat model of transient global cerebral ischemia.Graduate school application can be a foreboding task. Many undergraduate students are unfamiliar with the review procedures and selection criteria that are used by the various graduate schools. Consequently, students often fail to present their applications in a manner that will make them most attractive to their chosen school. It is imperative that applicants prepare themselves by becoming familiar with the requirements and expectations of their chosen school. This is a task that students should undertake as early in their undergraduate career as possible. <p>In order to avoid the frustration of rejection, any undergraduate applicant should do three things: 1) Consult with an Academic Advisor at the undergraduate institution (as early as possible). 2) Find out as much as possible about the available graduate programs in your chosen field of study, and consult with potential graduate supervisors in the appropriate graduate schools. 3) Read "Graduate School : Winning Strategies for Getting in With or Without Excellent Grades". </p><p>This book is an excellent orientation to the process of graduate school application. Dr. Mumby provides a very clear and easy-to-read analysis of what you should know when you select a program, how you should prepare an application for that program, and how you should follow up that application in an appropriate and timely fashion. This book will make the application process less daunting, and will help students overcome some of the pitfalls that may otherwise handicap their application. Dr. Mumby also makes some specific recommendations that will enhance students' applications. These suggestions range from finer points of style, to major tasks such as involvement in graduate-style academic activities at the undergraduate level. The book is a must-read for anyone considering application to graduate school. Undergraduate Advisors will also find that it is a useful tool in their academic advising activities with prospective graduate students. <br>--<i>Darragh P. Devine, Ph.D. University of Florida</i><br><br>I have read the excerpts... The parts I read have a lot of very useful information in it that will help prospective students understand the process. This is a good thing, that will indirectly also help supervisors looking for students <br>--<i>Norman White, Ph.D. McGill University</i><br><br>This book made a significant contribution in helping me maximize the impact of each of the components required toward creating an effective application package. Mumby s writing style is very personable, easy to understand and offers a thorough account of the practical steps needed to convey your unique qualifications in the best possible light, thus creating a more favorable impact on a schools selection committee. As a member of such admissions committees himself, Mumby offers invaluable insights concerning what they are looking for when assessing a students application. </p><p>The sections of the book I most benefited from were on how to go about obtaining quality letters of recommendation, the importance of cultivating pre-application contact with prospective supervisors, and writing a personal statement that stands out from the crowd. What was also especially useful was a step-by-step timetable plan that gives you the big picture of what needs to be done and by when. I d often refer back to it to make sure I wasn t forgetting some of the crucial details the book recommends. </p><p>Following this books suggestions means in some cases doing prep work way in advance of application time, but if you read the book early enough you ll be well prepared to do those things that can make a huge difference in the depth, scope and quality of your presenting materials. In my experience, implementing this books recommendations required a substantial amount of effort and time, but with so much riding on the outcome, I found it well worth the extra care taken. </p><p>If you desire to create a presentation that sets you apart from the typical applicant, thereby greatly improving your chances of getting accepted into grad school, then I most heartily recommend this book. <br>--<i>Lorne Ouellet, MA, Counselling, McGill University</i></p></p><h2>Venom: Lethal Protector</h2><p>Venom - alien symbiote and defender of the innocent!

In the operating room, surgeons and their teams communicate in a very precise language; airplane pilots follow a strict protocol to take off and land safely every time; and, when launching a new product, companies lay out a plan that all employees follow. But when it comes to building a strong service culture, the path to success is usually much less clear. We relegate service to a single department guided by anecdotal wisdom and less-than-helpful clichés like the customer is always right. With global economies transforming at record speed, we are largely unprepared for the service demands we face day and night from around the world. We promise our customers satisfaction and then allow internal politics and inefficient methods to frustrate our ability to deliver. With service so much a part of our daily lives, both in and outside the workplace, why aren't we doing it better? New York Times bestselling author Ron Kaufman knows the answer to this question, and not only believes we can do it better, but shows us how. In Uplifting Service he takes you on a journey into a new world of service that is guided by fundamental principles and actionable models. After more than two decades helping leaders transform their service cultures, Kaufman has discovered that while each successful team is different, the architecture they apply to build an uplifting service culture is the same.In this New York Times, USA Today, and Amazon.com bestselling book, Kaufman lays out the steps you can take to build a sustainable culture that delivers outstanding service every day. He offers the tools and practices that have been proven effective in businesses, governments, communities, and homes; on every continent; and in many languages. Through perspective-changing insights and case studies, you will learn how the world's best performing companies have changed the game through service&#x201d;and how you too can follow this proven path to an uplifting transformation.</p><p>"Ron Kaufman has pinpointed a massive wound in society, and offers a strategy on how to uplift the world around us.

By the author of The Bread Winner.</p><p>Arvella Whitmore's children's novels include <i>The Bread Winner</i>, an NCSS-CBC Notable Children's Book in the Field of Social Studies. She and her husband reside in Minneapolis, Minnesota.Grade 5-8-Determined not to move to an integrated suburb, 12-year-old Jordan Henning Scott plans to run away and live with his newfound gang friends, but the heirloom watch he steals from his grandfather to finance this venture transports him back in time. Finding himself in the old South, Jordan meets Uriah, a slave boy who takes him to the Henning plantation. Jordan is presumed to be a runaway slave, put to exhausting work picking cotton, and whipped when he collapses. After he tries to run away, he is sold to a slave trader and then bought by a sympathizer who gives him freedom papers and promises to send him to Canada if he will return to the Henning plantation and convince Uriah to leave. The master, who turns out to be Uriah's father, had recently brought the boy into the big house and given him his watch for safekeeping. When Jordan finds the watch again, he is returned to his own time. Left behind, Uriah takes the papers and Jordan's name to Canada and becomes Jordan's great-great-great-great-grandfather. Readers who can overlook awkward dialogue and an unlikely plot will be caught up in the boy's efforts to survive and appropriately appalled by the details of daily life. The premise of a modern eye looking at the grim realities of slavery was used more successfully, but for older readers, by Octavia Butler in Kindred (Beacon, 1988); Trapped, however, might intrigue readers looking for quick-moving historical fiction.<br><i>Kathleen Isaacs, Edmund Burke School, Washington, DC</i><br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>In God We Trust: Stories of Faith in American History</h2><p><p><b>History Comes Alive In A Fun Way!<br></b><br></p><p><i> and #147;God cannot support this free and blessed country unless Christians take a stand for what is right.

He was taken from his unmarried mother&#x2019;s womb three months prematurely when she was killed in a car wreck. After ninety-six days of seesawing between life and death, HK&#x2019;s grandmother took him home.</p><p>One Saturday morning Jim Bradford, a successful businessman in his mid-fifties, happens into Mrs. Winner&#x2019;s Chicken and Biscuits and sees a nine-year-old&#x2019;s head pressed down against a black plastic boom box with a crooked antenna and three strips of silver duct tape stretched across the battery cover. He can&#x2019;t help but notice the long, white plastic braces on each of the child&#x2019;s legs. Mr. Bradford learns that HK&#x2019;s grandmother is forced to bring him to the fast-food restaurant where she works, leaving him to sit alone all day at a small table, with only his boom box for company. On subsequent Saturdays Jim feels drawn back to the restaurant to meet with HK and begins spending every weekend with him.</p><p>Eventually it becomes apparent that buried beneath HK&#x2019;s severe disabilities is one spectacular ability. He is diagnosed with Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory (HSAM), which involves superlative powers of recollection that enable him to remember everything that has happened to him since the age of three. Less than one hundred people have been diagnosed with HSAM, but none of them have the physical disabilities of HK Derryberry.</p><p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p></p><p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br><br><p>Andy Hardin has known Jim Bradford over twenty-five years through church and was part of his Saturday morning tennis group when Jim first met HK. Jim introduced Andy to HK early in their friendship, and he closely followed their adventures throughout the years. After reading Jim&#x2019;s treasured tales of HK&#x2019;s many anecdotes, Andy offered his help to further develop the story. Andy is a retired attorney living in Nashville, Tennessee with his wife, Connie.</p></p><h2>Vocabulary Workshop Achieve Level G Grade 12</h2><p>This series for upper grades has a focus on teaching fewer words at a time to deepen students&#39; understanding of each word&#39;s meaning.

California&#x2019;s indigenous tribes were forced off their lands first by Spanish settlers, then by the arrival of gold miners from every corner of the world. Because of its Catholic missionary history, Gold Rush California did not experience a more exclusive eastern-style Protestantism. This permitted more rapid and inclusive acculturation. California Jews, unlike their eastern counterparts whose arrival often followed that of European Protestants, were often among the first settlers to establish a west coast community. Jewish immigrants to California took advantage of its physical environment, ethnic diversity, and cultural distinctiveness to fashion a form of Judaism unique in the American experience. California Jews enjoyed unprecedented access to political power a generation earlier than their New York counterparts. They thrived in the multicultural mix, redefining the classic black-white racial binary by forging relations with a variety of religious and ethnic groups in both San Francisco and Los Angeles.</p><p>9 x 11 1/4 trim. 122 illus.AVA F.

He happily lives with the love of his life and their two super fun kids in the land of flying salmon where he gets to believe in his ideas all day long. He thinks he just might be the luckiest person on the planet.A paean to teachers and their surrogates everywhere.<br><br>This gentle ode to a teacher's skill at inspiring, encouraging, and being a role model is spoken, presumably, from a child's viewpoint. However, the voice could equally be that of an adult, because who can't look back upon teachers or other early mentors who gave of themselves and offered their pupils so much? Indeed, some of the self-aware, self-assured expressions herein seem perhaps more realistic as uttered from one who's already grown. Alternatively, readers won't fail to note that this small book, illustrated with gentle soy-ink drawings and featuring an adult-child bear duo engaged in various sedentary and lively pursuits, could just as easily be about human parent- (or grandparent-) child pairs: some of the softly colored illustrations depict scenarios that are more likely to occur within a home and/or other family-oriented setting. Makes sense: aren't parents and other close family members children's first teachers? This duality suggests that the book might be best shared one-on-one between a nostalgic adult and a child who's developed some self-confidence, having learned a thing or two from a parent, grandparent, older relative, or classroom instructor.<br><br>A sweet, soft conversation starter and a charming gift.

Her unique insight has both Dietetic Associations and politically correct, so-called alternative health advocates scrambling to justify their broken theories about health that have contributed to the current outbreak of new and seemingly irreparable diseases. Ms. Hew began her holistic health journey after suffering innumerable health problems while following the American Dietetics Association&#x2019;s dietary recommendations. Her brush with death, after being treated by a now very popular vegan doctor, set her on a quest to learn the dietary commonalities amongst all healthy societies. Using her fluency in three languages, she has been able to uncover many long forgotten food traditions throughout the world. Receiving a certificate in Chinese dietetics in 2002 and her degree as a Certified Nutritionist in 2004, she has helped many clients and workshop attendees to decode their own health dilemmas by understanding the inconsistencies in conventional nutritional dogma. As a cook, her recipes have been popular with everyone from celebrated chefs to picky 4 year olds and adults who &#x201c;don&#x2019;t eat that&#x201d;.

Yikes! It's two of Santa's elves who are Christmas Eve stowaways. Beloved illustrator Jan Brett's version of <i>The Night Before Christmas</i> lets these two mischievous elves add their rambunctious spirit to this familiar 1823 rhyming story. Here, Santa and his reindeer land on the snowy roof of a Victorian mansion in New England. While Santa delivers the toys inside, the elves and the reindeer frolic around the lawn, as a pig (earmarked for a girl named Jan) and a few alphabet blocks spill out of sacks into the snow. Santa swiftly reins in the mischief-makers and "away they all flew like the down on a thistle." Brett's richly illustrated borders are lavishly decorated with antique toys, ornaments, and sweet treats, all surrounded with twisting golden ribbons. They also give us a window on the mansion's inhabitants, including the children watching Santa's departure in awe. A sugarplum of a Christmas story, just right for a reading before "a long winter's nap." (Click to see a sample spread. Illustrations �1998 by Jan Brett. Published by G.P. Putnam's Sons, a division of Penguin Putnam Books for Young Readers.) (Ages 3 to 6) <i>--Marcie Bovetz</i>Clement C. Moore's beloved poem about Santa's arrival on Christmas Eve has been illustrated by hundreds of artists since its first publication in 1823. Two collectors of antique children's books have selected a variety of these charming pictures from Arthur Rackham, Jessie Willcox Smith, Thomas Nast, and other renowned children's illustrators of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Most of the images are from versions of the poem; a few are from antique postcards or magazines. Source notes for all the illustrations are included. Santa is dressed differently by each artist, but he is always "chubby and plump--a right jolly old elf" who brings joy to all good little girls and boys. This attractive edition of <i>The Night Before Christmas</i> will be enjoyed most by collectors of children's books or lovers of things Victorian. Youngsters who are already familiar with the poem will delight in comparing the different old-fashioned Santas and the children of long ago "nestled all snug in their beds." A charming holiday gift to leave under the tree on Christmas Eve for anyone who believes in the magic of Santa Claus.

Ideal to be read and treasured, it makes for a perfect addition to any library. The oldest extant works of Western literature, Homer s the Iliad and the Odyssey are an important part of the Greek culture. The Iliad gives a detailed poetic description of the war of Troy and expounds the battle and the events during the weeks of quarrels between King Agamemnon and warrior Achilles. The Odyssey expounds Homer s energetic vision of everyman s journey through life. It recounts the tale of Ulysses nostros journey back home, after the ten-year-long Trojan War and the fall of the city of Troy.</p><p>Homer is known to have authored the first known literature of Europe. He is revered as one of the greatest of the ancient Greek epic poets in the Western classical tradition and is credited with the enduring epic tales of the Illiad and the Odyssey, which were an important part of the Greek culture. Though when he lived is not known, it is estimated by Herodotus, a Greek historian, that Homer lived around 400 years before his own time. This places him somewhere around 800-900 BC. While some ancient sources claim that he lived close to the supposed time of the Trojan War, i.e. in the early 12th century BC, most modern researchers place him in the 7th or 8th century BC. Plato s the Republic describes Homer s significance to the ancient Greeks. He was described as the teacher of Greece, for the growing influence of Homeric epics in shaping Greek culture was widely recognized. His works are about fifty per cent speeches and provide models in persuasive writing and speaking.</p><h2>Splat the Cat: I Scream for Ice Cream (I Can Read Level 1)</h2><p><p><strong>Join Splat and his class on a field trip to an ice cream factory in this delectable I Can Read book from <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author-artist Rob Scotton. </strong></p><p>Splat can barely sit still during the bus ride.

They have worked with Girl Scouts of America and various schools.<br><br>&#x2192; MEDIUM<br><br><b>"DOWN"</b><br><br>&#x201c;Down&#x201d; is the command for a dog to lie down and teaches your dog good manners by putting them in the resting position. When a dog&#x2019;s body is in a resting position, it&#x2019;s easier for them to calm their mind as well. Think about it&#x2014;don&#x2019;t you feel more relaxed when you are lying down? Your dog does, too! <br><br><b>ITEMS NEEDED </b><br>�&nbsp;High-value treats in both hands <br>�&nbsp;A blanket or towel for your dog to lie on, preferably one they already use <br><br><i>Learn this first: &#x201c;Sit&#x201d; (page 52) </i><br><br>STEP 1 <br>Lay the blanket or towel down for your dog. Put small pieces of high-value treats into both of your hands and make them into fists. Place one hand behind your back. Using the other hand to demonstrate that you have a treat, lure and call your dog over to the blanket. <br><br>STEP 2 <br>Tell your dog to &#x201c;Sit&#x201d; on the blanket or towel. Once they are in a steady sit position, kneel down to get closer to your dog&#x2019;s level. <br><br>STEP 3 <br>Just like you did with the &#x201c;Sit&#x201d; command, hold one of your treat hands close to your dog&#x2019;s nose. Slowly move your hand down in a straight line toward the floor or their toes. This technique is called &#x201c;nose to toes.&#x201d; The goal is for your dog&#x2019;s head to follow your hand into a lying down position. Your pup may lick at your treat hand as they move downward; this is okay. Once they lie, use a marker word and give them a treat&#x2014;not from the front hand, but from the hand that was behind your back. Practice this exercise five times. <br><br>STEP 4 <br>Now repeat the exercise using the word &#x201c;Down&#x201d; just like when you taught your dog &#x201c;Sit.&#x201d; Each day, make your dog lie in the &#x201c;Down&#x201d; position a little bit longer before rewarding them with your marker word and treat. Once they have mastered &#x201c;Down&#x201d; while you are kneeling, begin practicing &#x201c;Down&#x201d; while you are standing up. <br>Next, do the hand luring gesture without any treats in the luring hand and without going all the way down to the ground. The less you use treats as a reward, the more you can use affection and petting as the prize.<br><br><b>SAFETY!</b><br>Only practice this command once your dog has learned to gently take treats from your hand. Otherwise, they may try to use their teeth to nibble at your fist to get the treat!<br><br><b>TIPS <br></b><br><i>PROBLEM SOLVING </i><br>� It is much easier to teach a dog &#x201c;Down&#x201d; after they know how to do &#x201c;Sit&#x201d; without always expecting a treat. Some dogs will pop right back up in a sitting or standing position as soon as they lie down on command. Try rewarding them for simply lying down for a while when you&#x2019;re not in the middle of a lesson. Casually walk over to them, use your marker word, and give them a treat. When you practice the &#x201c;Down&#x201d; training sessions, they will start to make the connection that only when they stay in a lying down position will they receive a reward. <br><br>� It&#x2019;s important to practice &#x201c;Down&#x201d; in different spaces and on different surfaces. Some dogs need their security blanket or towel to remember that they can perform the command in a different setting. So, if you are trying to teach your dog &#x201c;Down&#x201d; on a driveway or a grassy surface, start by practicing with their towel or blanket on the driveway or grass, and then use it less often over the next week. <br><br>� When a dog is following the lure downward, their backside may go up in the air like in a downward dog yoga position. Sorry, doggie, that&#x2019;s only half down! Have a helper with you if your dog usually does this. Your helper can gently push your dog&#x2019;s backside downward (if your dog is okay with this) while you slowly pull the treat toward you, keeping your hand along the floor. Your dog&#x2019;s body should naturally lie out on the ground as their nose keeps reaching for your luring hand.</p><h2>The Official Ninja Foodi: Pressure Cooker that Crisps: Complete Cookbook for Beginners: Your Expert Guide to Pressure Cook, Air Fry, Dehydrate, and More (Ninja Cookbooks)</h2><p><p><strong>The <em>Ninja� Foodi&#x2122; Complete Cookbook for Beginners</em> is the official companion cookbook and starter guide to make easy, everyday meals with your Ninja� Foodi&#x2122;.</strong></p><p>The Ninja� Foodi&#x2122; delivers a whole new way of cooking that combines the speed of a pressure cooker with the quick-crisping action of an air fryer.

So does Spot! Join Spot as he visits his dad, working on the farm, and help Spot look for baby animals. Animal sounds pique Spot&#39;s curiosity, and lift-the-flaps reveal who is underneath. After an adventurous search for baby animals, Spot finally finds a litter of kittens. This board book also features a full-color cover, with rounded-edge, sturdy pages that will stand the test of time.</p><p>Eric Hill (1927-2014) started his artistic career as an art studio messenger and from there went on to become a cartoonist and eventually an art director at a leading advertising agency. In 1978 Eric made up a story about a small puppy to read to his son at bedtime and Spot was born. The success of his first bestselling lift-the-flap classic <i>Where's Spot?</i> in 1980 convinced him to become a full-time author, and his Spot books have been enjoyed by children around the world ever since. In 2008 he was awarded an OBE for services to children's literacy.PreSchool-K Puppy Spot visits his tractor-driving dad on the farm. Dad sets out to show Spot some baby animals. Spot runs here and there, looking in the barn, in the stable, behind fences, and under bushes for the baby animals. He finally finds the piglets that Dad wanted to show him. Spot then finds and shows Dad some baby kittens in a laundry basket. The bright colors, simple text, and large print on heavy paper make the book attractive, but the lift-up flaps (barn doors, bushes, and gates) which open to reveal more animals are not practical for a circulating library collection.

Inside you will find simple illustrations that cover the necessities of drawing cool stuff. Specific exercises are provided that offer step-by-step guidelines for drawing a variety of subjects. Each lesson starts with an easy-to-draw shape that will become the basic structure of the drawing. From there, each step adds elements to that structure, allowing the artist to build on their creation and make a more detailed image. Starting with the basic forms, the artist is provided a guide to help see objects in terms of simplified shapes. Instructions for shading to add depth, contrast, character and movement to a drawing are then covered. The varieties of texture and pattern that can be included in an artwork offer another layer of interest and depth to a design. These elements are necessary to indicate the way something looks like it feels in a work (texture) or creating the repetition of shapes, lines or colors (patterns). Illustrated optical illusions involve images that are sensed and perceived to be different from what they really are, showing examples of how the mind and the eyes can play tricks on each other. All you need is a piece of paper, a pencil and an eraser and you are ready to draw cool stuff. Once the drawing is complete, it can be colored, shaded or designed in any way you like to make it original. Following these exercises is a great way to practice your craft and begin seeing things in terms of simple shapes within a complex object.</p><p>Catherine V.

Soon only the tiniest seed remains, growing into a giant flower and, when autumn returns, sending its own seeds into the wind to start the process over again.Eric Carle is an internationally bestselling and award-winning author and illustrator of more than seventy books for very young children, including <i>The Tiny Seed</i>, <i>Papa, Please Get the Moon for Me</i>,&nbsp;and his most well-known title, <i>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</i>.

But it was his decision to acknowledge his emotions and yield to God&#x2019;s call on his life that made Wilson the man and leader he is today.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> As the founder of one of the country&#x2019;s most esteemed youth organizations, Wilson has decades of experience in strengthening the physical, mental, and emotional spirit of boys and men.

No matter what the situation was, I was told to always &#x2018;be a man&#x2019; and suck it up.

And why not? He was a natural at football, basketball, and, of course, baseball. But beyond athletic skill, it was his strength of character that secured his place in sports history.

It was tough being first- not only did &#34;fans&#34; send hate mail but some of his own teammates refused to accept him.

(What Was?)</h2><p><b>Step back in time to the birth of America and meet the real-life rebels who made this country free!</b><br><br>On a hot summer day near Philadelphia in 1776, Thomas Jefferson sat at his desk and wrote furiously until early the next morning. He was drafting the Declaration of Independence, a document that would sever this country's ties with Britain and announce a new nation&#x2014;The United States of America. Colonists were willing to risk their lives for freedom, and the Declaration of Independence made that official. Discover the true story of one of the most radical and uplifting documents in history and follow the action that fueled the Revolutionary War.</p><p>Michael C. Harris is a freelance writer and college writing instructor based in Evanton, Illinois, where he lives with his wife, two soccer-loving sons, a dwarf hamster, a gecko, and a really weird cat. He has written a number of books for kids&#x2014;including Cool Science titles about artificial intelligence, weird diseases, and spare body parts for humans.<b>What Is the Declaration of Independence?</b><br> &nbsp;<br>June 26, 1776, Philadelphia<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The June heat in Philadelphia was blistering. Even before the sun came up, it was hot. Thomas Jefferson of Virginia did his best to stay cool as he wrote in the room he had rented on Market Street. He was writing a letter. But it was no ordinary letter.<br> &nbsp;<br> Along with Jefferson, important men from all thirteen American colonies had come to Philadelphia. They planned to do something brave and dangerous. The colonies were declaring their freedom from Great Britain. They were going to create a new country&#x2014;the United States of America.<br> &nbsp;<br> Thomas Jefferson was chosen to write a public letter to the British king listing all the reasons why people in America were rebelling. Jefferson also wanted the letter to show other countries in Europe why this was the right decision for America. It took Jefferson&#x2014;with help from others&#x2014;only a couple of weeks to finish one of the most important documents in history: the Declaration of Independence.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sending an announcement like this&#x2014;a declaration&#x2014;meant that the colonists in America would go to war. The British army was large and powerful. The colonists didn&#x2019;t even have an army. The chances were slim that the Americans could win. Many would certainly die. And even if by some chance the colonists did win their freedom, could thirteen different colonies create a new country together?<br> &nbsp;<br> For two weeks Jefferson worked on the Declaration of Independence. He sat at the small desk that he had made by hand. He wrote in ink on large sheets of paper with his quill pen.<br> &nbsp;<br> Each day Jefferson would discuss the ideas for the declaration with some of the other men who had gathered in Philadelphia. After these talks, Jefferson would sometimes tear up his most recent draft of the declaration and start over.<br> &nbsp;<br> He wanted to get every word just right. The declaration had to explain more than why the colonies could no longer live under British rule. More importantly, it had to tell the world what this new country hoped to stand for. It would not have a king. It would set up a government in which ordinary men decided the laws.<br> &nbsp;<br> After the Declaration of Independence was finished, it was signed on July 4, 1776. It has become one of the most important statements of freedom. It has inspired people around the globe to fight for their freedom as well. Thomas Jefferson wrote, &#x201c;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.&#x201d; This meant that this new United States would treat everyone the same. Jefferson may not have realized how powerful those simple words would be for hundreds of years to come.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>Chapter 1:&nbsp;A Battle for America</b><br>&nbsp;<br> After Columbus set foot in the &#x201c;New World&#x201d; in 1492, many European countries wanted to rule different parts of North America. Great Britain, France, and Spain controlled almost the entire continent. <br> &nbsp;<br> Great Britain had thirteen colonies along the east coast, where most settlers lived. France&#x2014;Great Britain&#x2019;s great rival&#x2014;had the largest area of land, north and west of the colonies. But not many settlers lived there. Same with Spain&#x2014;it had a bigger chunk of land than Great Britain but with far fewer people.<br> &nbsp;<br> In 1754, Great Britain tried to grab more of North America by invading lands controlled by the French. This led to a war known as the French and Indian War. <br> &nbsp;<br> A young lieutenant colonel named George Washington served in the British army, fighting against the French. <br> &nbsp;<br> Most American colonists wanted Great Britain to win the war with France. And, after many years, it did. Great Britain doubled the area of land it controlled.<br> &nbsp;<br> During the war, many British soldiers were sent to America to fight. That had been very costly. King George III had to borrow massive amounts of money from other countries.<br> &nbsp;<br> After winning the war, King George III had to pay back what he owed. In the king&#x2019;s mind, he had been defending the American colonies against the French. So he expected the colonies to help with the war debt. This angered people in America. It wasn&#x2019;t the colonists&#x2019; idea to start the war. It had been fought because the king wanted more land. So why should Americans have to pay?<br> &nbsp;<br> King George III didn&#x2019;t listen to that argument. The British government&#x2014;called Parliament&#x2014;taxed the American colonists heavily to pay for the war debts. The American colonists had no one representing them in Parliament. It met in London, more than three thousand miles away and across the Atlantic Ocean. The colonists had no way to argue against the high taxes.<br> &nbsp;<br> Did Parliament decide on all laws governing the colonies? No. There were local governments with men elected by their fellow colonists. <br> &nbsp;<br> In Virginia, for example, there was the House of Burgesses. However, none of these groups had much power. In each colony, a royal governor made all the important decisions. Whatever the governor decided should be the law <i>was</i> the law. And he was appointed by the king. So Great Britain always had the final say about all laws and taxes. This got people in the colonies angry. Very angry.</p><h2>Busy Noisy Farm: Interactive Children&#39;s Sound Book with 10 Farmyard Noises to Enhance the Story (Interactive Early Bird Children&#39;s Song Book with 10 Sing-Along Tunes)</h2><p>With the look and feel of a <strong>classic children's book</strong>, Busy Noisy Farm is a first look and listen around the farm. <br>As you read the story, you will see picture icons that cue little ones to find the buttons and play the sound effects.

His first night away from home....and from Mama. But he makes sure to pack everything he needs. And there are so many fun things to do with Gram and Grandpa. It&#x2019;s not until he gets ready for bed that he realizes that he&#x2019;s forgotten something important. Fuzzy Llama! Fortunately, Grandpa Llama has a wonderful solution and soon Llama Llama is having sweet dreams.</p><p><p>Anna Dewdney was a teacher, mother, and enthusiastic proponent of reading aloud to children. She continually honed her skills as an artist and writer and published her first Llama Llama book in 2005. Her passion for creating extended to home and garden and she lovingly restored an 18th century farmhouse in southern Vermont. She wrote, painted, gardened, and lived there with her partner, Reed, her two daughters, two wirehaired pointing griffons, and one bulldog.&nbsp;Anna passed away in 2016, but her spirit will live on in her books.</p>PreS&#x2014;Dewdney tackles the topic of staying at Gram and Grandpa's overnight. Llama is excited for his special visit as he packs up his clothes and his stuffed animal, Fuzzy Llama. However, when he unpacks, he realizes, rather upsettingly, that his comfort object was left behind. Gram and Grandpa spend the day distracting little Llama by playing outside or building in the workshop, but with each activity, he anxiously remembers Fuzzy Llama's absence. While the text carries along with a seemingly pleasing nighttime routine ("Take a bath./Then comb and brush./Settle in for stories. Hush./Finish books/and get a kiss"), the illustrations show Llama looking more distressed and anxious before bed. After Gram asks what's the matter, we watch as "Llama's lips begin to quiver./Llama starts to shake and shiver./Llama needs his Fuzzy near,/but FUZZY LLAMA ISN'T HERE!" The following page shows all three Llamas looking at readers for help. Quickly, it's Grandpa who finds a solution. Grandpa offers a special toy from when he was just a little boy. In a satisfying ending, Llama realizes he's not alone and that he's in his "home... away from home." With a carefully crafted rhyming text and comforting painted images that match genuinely the emotion of a toddler's first night away from home, this book is a charming success. VERDICT Parents and caregivers will appreciate the reassuring message that this story offers for one-on-one sharing, and it will function as a heartwarming read-aloud in a bedtime-themed storytime.&#x2014;Brianne Colombo, Pequannock Township Public Library, NJ</p><h2>The Art Of Saying NO: How To Stand Your Ground, Reclaim Your Time And Energy, And Refuse To Be Taken For Granted (Without Feeling Guilty!)

We were all happily getting along with our analog pots and pans, and then, in the blink of an eye, an army of these programmable electric pressure cookers appeared on kitchen counters the world over. Instant Pots had charmed their way into the hearts of millions of home cooks seemingly overnight.<br><br>No doubt, part of the Instant Pot&#x2019;s immediate success is owed to its catchy name: the term &#x201c;instant&#x201d; makes some big promises. It sounds like you&#x2019;ll be able to toss some ingredients into the pot, press a button, and a complete dinner will appear in an instant, � la that space-age stove on <i>The Jetsons</i>.<br><br>Although that isn&#x2019;t really the case (hard-boiled eggs in the Instant Pot <i>do </i>come pretty close!), there&#x2019;s enormous appeal in the Instant Pot&#x2019;s convenience and adaptability. Any meal requires some prep on the front end, but once the Instant Pot is sealed and set to a pressure-cooking setting, you can walk out of the kitchen and not look back. It&#x2019;s the ultimate appliance in &#x201c;set it and forget it&#x201d; cooking. If you&#x2019;re making a dish such as Split Pea Soup (page 86) or Lamb and White Bean Tagine, it&#x2019;ll pressure-cook to perfection, then stay warm on the Keep Warm setting until you&#x2019;re ready to enjoy your home-cooked meal, for up to 10 hours.<br><br>As far as the &#x201c;instant&#x201d; factor goes, the recipes for which you&#x2019;ll see the biggest time savings include long-cooking meats, dried beans, and other ingredients that would otherwise braise in the oven or simmer on the stove for hours. In the Instant Pot, Rosemary-Dijon Pot Roast, dried chickpeas for Roasted Red Pepper Hummus, and Pumpkin Spice Steel-Cut Oatmeal really do cook in about half the time.<br><br>Thanks to its flexibility and ability to cook speedily, the Instant Pot allows you to incorporate wholesome home-cooked meals into your weekly routine, regardless of your schedule. Whether you like to prepare meals for the entire week on the weekends, get your cooking done in the mornings, or throw together seat-of-your-pants weeknight dinners, there are recipes in this book to suit your lifestyle.&nbsp;<br><br>In addition to lots and lots of recipes (two hundred!), I&#x2019;ve included all of the information you need to start using your Instant Pot like a pro. You&#x2019;ll find a list of my favorite tools and accessories, an expansive FAQ, explanations for every program setting on the pot, tips for tricky ingredients (page 301), and more. Once you get to the recipes themselves, you&#x2019;ll see that I&#x2019;ve included clear instructions at every step, so you never have to wonder which setting to select, when to seal the pot, or how long to wait before you can open it. In addition, there&#x2019;s a chapter of pantry staples that includes essentials like broths, stocks, sauces, and pickles that will make every meal more convenient and delicious.<br><br>I hope that this book becomes a new classic in your kitchen and encourages you to plug in your Instant Pot and get cooking right away.

One of those that made your eyes water and forced you to tuck your nose under your shirt collar. It must have been hot and steamy coming out, because there&#x2019;s no other explanation for its horrid stench. I know, it sounds like your classic silent-but-deadly--it wasn&#x2019;t. Her fart ripped like a firecracker when it went off. That&#x2019;s right--it wasn&#x2019;t me! It was Lexie!<br><br> She dropped her stink bomb one day during the summer when we were helping Mr. T move our old classroom down to the sixth-grade annex. After last year, I wanted to spend all my time with Mr. T. I didn&#x2019;t want a day to go by that I wasn&#x2019;t with him. That&#x2019;s why I spent my vacation helping him with the move. Besides, Mom and Dad weren&#x2019;t around. They were working all the time--even in the summer, business called. And my older brother, Richard, was off doing his own thing, which was DJing. He had his own equipment and did small parties, birthdays mostly. It wasn&#x2019;t like we needed the money, and Mom and Dad didn&#x2019;t force him to get a job, but that&#x2019;s what he did. He said it helped him get the girls.<br><br> Lexie and I weren&#x2019;t the only ones choosing to hang with Mr. T. Anna and Ms. Newberry helped a lot, and Jeffrey showed up some, too. There weren&#x2019;t a lot of other people around school in the beginning, just our custodians, office staff, and our principal, Mrs. Williams.<br><br> I was on my way to our classroom one morning and stopped to take a leak before heading upstairs. There was a bathroom around the corner from the office that no one ever used, a small bathroom with a single urinal and stall. I don&#x2019;t know what possessed me, but I&#x2019;ve always liked to mess around in bathrooms. Old habits die hard. I walked in and the stall door stared back at me with a funny look on its face.<br><br> &#x201c;Hi-ya!&#x201d; I yelled, running and throwing a roundhouse karate kick at my target. I didn&#x2019;t actually know martial arts, but I&#x2019;d seen the move on TV. The door banged open and slammed shut after ricocheting off the wall.<br><br> &#x201c;Ahh!&#x201d; someone screamed.<br><br> Huh! I didn&#x2019;t expect anybody to be in there. Like I said, no one ever uses this bathroom.<br><br> &#x201c;Peter, I&#x2019;m gonna kill you!&#x201d; Jeffrey barged out of the stall. I had scared the snot out of him, all right--I could tell. He must have sprayed everywhere. He had wet spots all over his pants. I wanted to laugh, but Jeffrey glared at me.<br><br> I backed to the door. &#x201c;I--I didn&#x2019;t know you were in there. I swear.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You better grow eyes in the back of your head,&#x201d; he warned.<br><br> I yanked the door open and hurried upstairs while Jeffrey stayed behind, probably to dry his pants. I got to work helping Mr. T.<br><br> If you&#x2019;ve ever moved, then you know it&#x2019;s all about boxes. Packing boxes, lifting boxes, and unpacking boxes. Boxes, boxes, and more boxes. After a while I got sick of them, so I tried cramming one with as much as I could fit, thinking that more stuff in each box would mean less boxes all together in the end. Luke, our class brainiac, would have been proud of my smarts. The problem was, I forgot about needing to lift the box after jamming it full of books and anything else I could get inside.<br><br> &#x201c;Peter, you&#x2019;ve got too much in there,&#x201d; Anna warned. &#x201c;You should take some stuff out.&#x201d;<br><br> I liked Anna and all, but I wasn&#x2019;t about to listen to a girl. I managed to pick the box up after almost getting a hernia, but then the stupid bottom fell out. I stood there like a dork, holding an empty cardboard box with junk all around my feet. Mr. T and Ms. Newberry got a good chuckle, and I know Anna had to bite her tongue.<br><br> After the super-heavy box strategy failed, I decided I&#x2019;d take two normal-sized boxes and stack them one on top of the other. My idea was that two at once would lead to fewer box trips. Luke would have been proud again. The problem this time wasn&#x2019;t that they were too heavy, but that I couldn&#x2019;t see very well. I got the two lifted and started on my way, but I didn&#x2019;t make it very far before I ran into one of the classroom desks. The corner hit me right in the you-know-what. I dropped the boxes and balled up on the ground, groaning and holding my privates. You&#x2019;d think a boy would get some sympathy from a male teacher after an injury like that, but Mr. T had a funny way of showing he cared.<br><br> &#x201c;Ahh, c&#x2019;mon. You&#x2019;re all right, Peter,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re just peanuts.&#x201d;<br><br> Even with my injury, he made me smile. Of course everyone else thought it was hysterical, especially Lexie.<br><br> &#x201c;Ohh, poor Peter&#x2019;s peanuts,&#x201d; she sang. &#x201c;Hey, it&#x2019;s a tongue twister. Poor Peter&#x2019;s Peanuts. Poor Peter&#x2019;s--&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Okay, Lexie,&#x201d; Mr. T said.<br><br> She thought it was a riot. She couldn&#x2019;t stop laughing. And then she got to laughing so hard that she farted--right out loud! A real stinker! Served her right. Lexie turned bright red in the face. I wasn&#x2019;t about to let her off easy by pretending nothing had happened.<br><br> &#x201c;Oh my God!&#x201d; I yelled.<br><br> &#x201c;What now?&#x201d; Mr. T asked, looking up from the box he had gone back to packing.<br><br> &#x201c;Peter farted,&#x201d; Lexie was quick to say.<br><br> &#x201c;What! No way! That was you!&#x201d; I was ready to wring her neck.<br><br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s classic cover-up, Peter,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Blaming someone else.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Are you nuts?!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We know you hurt your peanuts,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re sorry.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s enough, you two,&#x201d; Mr. T said. &#x201c;Someone farted. I don&#x2019;t care who, just don&#x2019;t do it again. It stinks.&#x201d; He covered his nose with his shirt and so did a laughing Ms. Newberry.<br><br> Lexie flashed me her devil smile.<br><br> &#x201c;Better go check your underwear after that one,&#x201d; I whispered. The only good thing about her fart was that it somehow made me forget about my privates hurting.<br><br> And so went my summer: watch out for Jeffrey, deal with Lexie, and hang with Mr. T. I had a good time.</p><h2>The Flippin&#39; Awesome Backyard Griddle Cookbook: Tasty Recipes, Pro Tips and Bold Ideas for Outdoor Flat Top Grillin&#39;</h2><p><b>Discover grillmaster Paul Sidoriak's delicious recipes for fantastic flat-top grillin'</b><br><br>Nothing&#x2019;s more fun than grillin&#x2019; up a mess of delicious eats in your own backyard.

The chronic kidney disease diet and CKD recipes and eating plan in this book are based on the research in <em>Stopping Kidney Disease</em>, the highest rated book on kidney disease which has benefited hundreds of patients.</p><p>It&#x2019;s simple.

The problem is today&#x2019;s kidney diets have nothing in common with our real goals.</p><p>Traditional and other current kidney diets focus on treating just three conditions as we all know: sodium, phosphorus, and potassium. However, most of us have many more comorbid conditions made worse by traditional kidney diets. We need to try and treat, cure or manage as many condi�tions as possible, not just three.

He has received awards from the Society of Illustrators, the Martha Kinney Cooper Ohioana Library Association, the National Cartoonists Society, and others. He lives in Ohio with his wife and a menagerie of dogs, cats, ponies, ducks, and a few unknown creatures.PreS-Gr 1&#x2014;Yet another take on "There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly!" In Colandro and Lee's ninth book about this old woman, first she swallows a frog (she was in a fog.) Then she proceeds to swallow some dirt, some seeds, the rain, the sunlight, some gloves, and finally a rake. ("That was a mistake!"). In the end, she burps out a colorful garden. The frog is returned to his flowery environment wishing everyone a "Happy Spring!" As in other books in the series, Lee has given the woman a very large mouth, so swallowing so many varied items is easy for her, except, of course, the rake. In the cartoon drawings, the colors are vivid and the illustrations are large, filling the spreads.

The Bear family has a new addition . . . a baby girl named Honey! However, Sister isn&#x2019;t sure she likes having the new baby in the tree house. Honey cries, is always hungry, and gets all the attention. Will things ever get better for Sister? Includes over 50 bonus stickers!</p><p>What fun! What excitement! What a nuisance. At least that&#39;s the way Sister Bear feels. If it isn&#39;t being fed, burped, or diapered, it&#39;s being dandled, cuddled, or kitchy-kitchy-kooed. Yes, Sister&#39;s pretty fed up with the fuss everyone&#39;s making over the new baby. Even the dolls make her angry, because they remind her of the baby. Then Sister gets a special homework assignment and, with a little help from wise old Mama, comes to believe that this new baby might just be a nifty addition to the Bear clan.Stan and Jan Berenstain were already successful cartoonists for magazines and adult humor books when they began writing children's books. The first story starring the bear family,&nbsp;<i>The Big Honey Hunt</i>, appeared in 1962.

(Manga University Presents ... How to Draw Manga)</h2><p><p>You want to draw manga, and Manga University will show you how. You'll get VERY good at this. After all, we've been teaching people just like you for over 20 years.</p> <p>"How to Draw Manga: Basics and Beyond!" is the latest in Manga University's lineup of best-selling instructional books. The book features more than 1,000 illustrations drawn by Japanese manga artists whose work has appeared in leading publications, including <i>Shonen Sunday</i> and <i>Young Jump.</i> You will learn how to draw like a professional because your teachers <i>are</i> professionals.</p> <p>We've divided the book into four easy-to-follow chapters that will have you drawing original characters from head to toe in no time at all:</p> <p><b>Heads First!</b> We begin at the top, with a chapter on how to draw heads. After all, heads are the first thing most people notice, in both art and out in the real world. And in art, just like in the real world, you want to make sure your characters make a vivid first impression ... whether they're completely human, or totally out-of-this-world.</p> <p><b>Let's Make Faces!</b> The expression the eyes are the window to the soul is particularly true when it comes to manga. You can tell a lot about a character's personality by peering into their eyes. In this chapter, we explain the basics of drawing eyes. But we don't stop there. We also cover noses, mouths, ears, and hair.</p> <p><b>All About Bodies!</b> Once we've covered faces, we move on to teaching you how to draw bodies. We go over the differences between male and female body proportions, count heads to determine the heights of our characters, and learn how to draw hands, arms, feet, and legs.</p> <p><b>Strike a Pose!</b> Our book's final chapter is all about making a physical statement. We show characters standing tall, sitting down, throwing punches, giving hugs, and more. Because even beautifully drawn characters look boring if they're frozen stiff.</p> <p>The book also includes a section on manga tools. Plus, you'll get to know the artists who contributed to the book through exclusive interviews in which they talk about their favorite manga and anime series, hobbies, how they work, and more!</p></p><p><p><b>MANGA UNIVERSITY,</b> established in 1998, is one of the world's leading publishers of English-language instructional manga, including the acclaimed "How to Draw Manga" series, the award-winning "Manga Cookbook" collection, and the "Kanji de Manga" language-learning series.</p> <p><b>RYO KATAGIRI</b> is a manga artist, comic essayist, and illustrator whose work frequently appears in leading Japanese manga publications, including <i>Shonen Sunday</i> and <i>Young Jump</i>.

Amazingly, it&#x2019;s the Junk Man himself who offers an alternative: 120 hours of community service . . . working for him.<br> &nbsp;<br> Arthur is given a rickety shopping cart and a list of the Seven Most Important Things: glass bottles, foil, cardboard, pieces of wood, lightbulbs, coffee cans, and mirrors.

Her first novel, <i>Trouble Don&#x2019;t Last,</i> won the Scott O&#x2019;Dell Award for Historical Fiction. The idea for <i>The Seventh Most Important Thing </i>began many years ago when she first saw outsider artist James Hampton&#x2019;s amazing work. She was disappointed that so little is known about Hampton and was intrigued that his work was brought to light by anonymous sources. It was the perfect foundation for this remarkable, inspiring novel.

The brick didn't topple off the decrepit building. It didn't fall from the heavens. Arthur Owens grabbed the brick with his own hands. He held it for a minute, noticing the cold weight of it--and then he raised his arm and flung it at the old trash picker known as the Junk Man, who was pushing a rusty grocery cart down the street.<br><br>Lucky for Arthur Owens, it was a windy day and his ability to see things at a distance had never been good. Also, the front wheel of the grocery cart wobbled off the sidewalk at precisely the right moment. As the old man leaned to straighten the cart, Arthur's brick slammed into his shoulder, sending him crumpling to the ground and the grocery cart skidding into the street.<br><br>If it hadn't been for the wind and the wobbly cart and Arthur's bad aim, it could have been a lot worse, everybody said. In the hospital later, the Junk Man told a newspaper reporter he believed it was an act of God.<br><br>"You being saved?" the reporter asked, already jotting down the answer he expected to hear.<br><br>"No" was the Junk Man's odd reply. "Me being hit."<br>Those were the facts. On November 9, 1963, the story ran in all three of the city's newspapers. One headline read: THIRTEEN-YEAR-OLD BOY ATTACKS CITY MAN. Then, in smaller type below, it said: Man Saved by Good Samaritan.<br><br>Most people didn't care much about the facts, though. They didn't care about the particular place where the crime happened--not a bad neighborhood, but not a good one either. Or how a newspaper delivery truck driver who'd taken a wrong turn spotted the injured man on the sidewalk and rushed him to a nearby hospital.<br><br>What everybody wanted to know was why.<br><br>Arthur Owens spent three weeks in the Juvenile Detention Home, better known as juvie, asking himself the same question.<br>Two<br><br>A lot happened during the three weeks Arthur was locked up--the worst being that President Kennedy was killed. Then the guy who killed President Kennedy was killed. And then the Thanksgiving holiday passed by without much mention in juvie or anywhere else. Arthur didn't mind missing it. Along with the rest of the world, he didn't have much to be thankful for.<br><br>Four days after Thanksgiving, Arthur was brought to the courthouse for the hearing that would decide his fate. He was seated in a long row of bad kids, so he figured it was going to be a while.<br><br>Unfortunately, the judge assigned to hear Arthur Owens's case was not a listening sort of man. Judge Philip Warner liked his billowy black robe and the sound of his own voice too much. He reminded Arthur of those big horseflies that get stuck in your window in the summertime and buzz like mad and won't quit no matter what you do.<br><br>As the morning dragged on, the temperature in the courtroom rose. If Arthur had ever wondered what the fires of hell were like, Judge Warner's courtroom was giving him a pretty good idea. People who had come in wearing their winter coats and wool suit jackets were down to their shirtsleeves.<br><br>Arthur kept his suit jacket neatly buttoned and his sleeves down. He knew it was what his mom would want.<br><br>Doing his best to stay awake, he tried to focus on the walls of the courtroom, which were covered with vertical panels of grooved wood. Arthur thought maybe the design was supposed to make the room appear sleek and modern, but the longer he stared at the panels, the more they seemed to ripple in sickening waves. He began to believe that even the walls had been designed as a kind of punishment.<br><br>The combination of all these things--the swimming walls, the heat, the sweat, and the judge's endless voice--made him feel as if he just might puke when his turn finally came.<br><br>"Arthur T. Owens, approach the bench," the bailiff called out.<br><br>It was only a few steps from his chair to the judge's bench, but to Arthur it felt like miles. He could sense the breathing, sweaty mass of people behind him the way you sense the weight of bullies right before they're about to smash you into a wall of lockers at school.<br><br>There had been a lot of bullies in juvie--it was practically a bully vacation spot.<br><br>No doubt some of the people in the courtroom were surprised to see what Arthur Owens looked like as he walked to the front. He wasn't your typical juvie thug. He didn't have meat slabs for hands, or full facial hair, or an insolent grin.<br><br>He thought he could hear a few whispers behind him. "That's him?"<br><br>Arthur Owens was slender, pale, and moody-looking. Maybe he was a little taller than some thirteen-year-olds--his father had been tall--but mostly, he was someone who wouldn't get noticed walking down the street. When his brown hair flopped over his eyes, Arthur had the bad habit of leaving it there, which drove his mother crazy. He also didn't smile much.<br><br>As Arthur glanced nervously at the long row of juvenile delinquents, he could tell he was one of the youngest of all the young criminals waiting on the judge that day. And from what he could see, he was the only person who was wearing an almost-new funeral suit that didn't fit him very well.<br>Three<br><br>Judge Warner took a moment to study Arthur Owens when he reached the bench. It was his way of making the kids squirm.<br><br>As the judge glared at him, Arthur tried to decide what to do with his hands and feet, which suddenly seemed to be completely useless objects. He crossed and uncrossed his arms, shifted from one foot to the other, and did his best to ignore the sickening flip-flopping in his stomach. Sweat made his undershirt stick to his back.<br><br>The judge finally spoke after glancing down at a piece of paper handed to him by the bailiff. "You are Arthur Thomas Owens?"<br><br>"Yes," Arthur thought he said.<br><br>"I didn't hear you, young man."<br><br>"Yes, Your Honor," Arthur replied, slightly louder.<br><br>"Look up at me when you are speaking."<br><br>Arthur swallowed. He hated looking at people when he was speaking. It made him feel like they could X-ray every thought in his head. Usually, he had his hair to hide behind, but that morning his mother had taken a pair of scissors to the front of it. "To make you look less guilty," she'd told him.<br><br>Arthur didn't think his hair had anything to do with his guilt, but there was nothing left now but a jagged fringe high above his forehead. He tugged at it with his fingers.<br><br>"Okay," he mumbled, glancing up at the judge's thick round glasses and oddly magnified eyes, then looking back down at his feet. There was a long pause, as if the judge was trying to decide if he was entitled to more respect than he was getting. The room was quiet, expectant.<br><br>When the judge's gaze finally returned to the paper in his hands, Arthur held back a loud sigh of relief.<br><br>"According to what I've read about your case, I understand you attacked a man named James Hampton in a vicious and unprovoked manner on November eighth. Is that correct, Mr. Owens?"<br><br>Arthur blinked, momentarily confused by the name.<br><br>James Hampton? Who was James Hampton?<br><br>It took him a minute to figure out the judge was talking about the old Junk Man. Arthur tried not to look surprised by the fact that the man had a real name.<br><br>Everybody had a name, of course, but he had to admit he'd never thought about the Junk Man having one. He couldn't recall anybody in the neighborhood ever using it--especially not a name as formal-sounding as James Hampton, which could have belonged to a school principal or somebody's grandfather.<br><br>It definitely didn't make Arthur feel any better about what he'd done.<br><br>It also didn't make him feel better to find out that the Junk Man--James Hampton--had come to court that day to watch what happened. He was seated in the crowd only a few rows back from where Arthur stood.<br><br>The judge pointed him out. A shocked breath caught in Arthur's throat.<br><br>He didn't even look like the same person.<br><br>The Junk Man's gray-white hair, usually disheveled, was now close-cut and carefully trimmed. He wasn't wearing his familiar raggedy clothes and foggy eyeglasses either. Instead, he had on a neatly pressed brown suit and striped orange tie. Somehow he appeared taller. And less crazy.<br><br>But you couldn't miss the heavy white cast covering one arm and the sling of fabric that formed a triangle, almost like the letter A for Arthur, across the old man's chest.<br><br>Arthur swallowed hard, staring at the cast, staring at what he'd done. The A seemed to get more visible, more accusing, the longer he stared at it.<br><br>"Mr. Owens, I'll repeat my question. Are you the one who attacked Mr. Hampton?"<br><br>"Yes, sir," Arthur whispered.<br><br>"Then I want you to look at this innocent man you injured--and, quite frankly, could have killed," the judge continued.<br><br>There was a murmur of outraged agreement in the courtroom.<br><br>"And I want you to tell me what was going through your mind that afternoon," said the judge, his voice rising. He was proud of his intimidating, kid-shaking baritone. "I want to know exactly what could have compelled you to throw a brick at Mr. Hampton as he was minding his own business walking down the street."<br><br>Arthur was silent. He looked at his feet. The too-long funeral pants made pools of black fabric over his polished shoes. He noticed how the orange carpet below them was nearly the same shade as the Junk Man's tie. He wondered if he'd be sentenced to jail for life if he refused to give a reason for what he'd done.<br><br>"Did you attack Mr. Hampton because he looked like a helpless old man--pardon my choice of words," the judge added apologetically, glancing in the direction of the Junk Man. "Did he seem like an easy target to you?"<br><br>"No, sir," Arthur heard himself answer reluctantly.<br><br>"Were you attempting to rob him?"<br><br>Arthur shook his head. Robbing the Junk Man would have been an almost-funny statement in any other place, but he didn't dare laugh, not even inside his own head.<br><br>"Was it his color that caused you to attack him?"<br><br>Color? Confused, Arthur turned to look at the Junk Man again, not sure what color the judge was referring to. Was he talking about the white cast? The orange tie?<br><br>The judge grew more impatient. "I am asking you, young man--and this is a very serious question--did you throw the brick at him because he is a black man?"<br><br>What? Arthur's stomach gave a sickening lurch. This was a possibility he'd never thought about. Never in a million years considered. He could feel his heart thudding wildly, his mind racing. The Junk Man wasn't a color. He was just the Junk Man.<br><br>But the man's skin was light brown. That was a fact.<br><br>And Arthur's was peeled-onion white. That was a fact too.<br><br>He'd just never put those two facts together.<br><br>Arthur knew people's race wasn't something you messed around with. There were marches and protests about it on television all the time--and Arthur didn't even pay much attention to the news. Could the judge truly believe he'd been trying to stir up some kind of trouble by hitting the Junk Man?<br><br>Although he had sworn to himself that he would say nothing--that he would never talk about what had made him so angry on that November afternoon--Arthur had no choice. His father wouldn't have wanted him to stay silent and be accused of something far worse.<br><br>So Arthur licked his dry lips and spoke.<br><br>"Your Honor," he said, trying to keep his voice from shaking. "It wasn't his color."<br><br>The judge's reply was icy. "Then what was it?"<br><br>Arthur knew the answer would sound crazy to everyone in the room. He knew no one would understand, and it would probably earn him a permanent bunk in juvie with nothing but olive-green clothes and bad food and lukewarm showers for the rest of his life.<br><br>Looking down at the floor, Arthur said in a barely audible voice, "It was because of his hat, Your Honor."<br><br>While this might have seemed like a smart-aleck answer to the judge, to the courtroom, and to anyone who heard it, it was, in fact, the truth. Arthur had thrown the brick because of a hat.<br>Four<br><br>The hat in question had been missing from the hall closet, along with everything else that had belonged to his father, when Arthur got home from school that November day. It was November 8, just as the judge had said. A Friday.<br><br>Arthur remembered opening the closet to hang up his stuff. He'd just taken off his coat and tossed his shoes inside when he realized something was different. The closet was tidy and half empty. It smelled like Murphy's oil soap.<br><br>With his heart hammering in his chest, he began pushing through the coats that were left, searching for his father's old corduroy jacket. It was a big, faded coat that held the shape of his father's shoulders and smelled of stale cigarette smoke and beer and motor oil, as if he'd just taken it off after getting home from work. (Arthur still liked to imagine that he had.)<br><br>Nothing.<br><br>Arthur's eyes darted toward the row of hat pegs, looking for the motorcycle cap that had belonged to his father. It was one of those slick Harley-Davidson caps--black leather with a silver chain and the orange-winged logo on the brim.<br><br>If you wanted to find Tom Owens in a crowd, all you had to do was look for that cap, sitting slightly to one side--never straight, always jaunty. He was wearing it in nearly every picture the family had of him.<br><br>But except for the one with his little sister's pink knit hat, all of the pegs were empty.<br><br>Feeling more and more uneasy, Arthur pounded up the stairs to his parents' room, making the walls of the small house shake. He and his sister shared one room at the top of the stairs. His parents shared the other. Both rooms were shabby. Arthur's family had never had a lot of money.<br><br>The door to his parents' room stood open. Arthur saw that the old radio his dad used to listen to ball games on was missing. The wedding picture that had always been on his parents' wall was gone. Even the ashtray on the windowsill--the one he'd made for his dad in art class in third grade, a hideous green-and-blue swirl of clay--wasn't there.</p><h2>The Little Book of Woodland Bird Songs</h2><p><p> Hear the songs and learn about 12 of North America's woodland birds. </p><p> Being able to identify a bird's song is a skill that brings joy and fosters an appreciation of nature. Some bird songs are distinctive and easily recognized, like the common loon and wild turkey. Hawks as a group are distinctive but the individual species vary, as do the owls. Picking up the songs of a Black-capped Chickadee and a White-breasted Nuthatch, however, is not easy. That is where this enchanting book comes into its own. </p><p> <i>The Little Book of Woodland Bird Songs</i> features recordings of twelve bird songs from some of the best-known woodland species seen and heard in North America. It is an interactive board book that is ideal for curious young readers. The sturdy pages are easy to turn and the twelve song buttons, each with a portrait of the bird, are easy to activate. The high-quality sound module is encased in durable plastic and the one-inch (3-cm) speaker makes it easy to hear and differentiate the elements of the bird's song, such as pitch, tempo and trills. </p><p> Beautiful lifelike illustrations aid in identifying the birds and a descriptive paragraph and facts panel provide information such as the time of day the bird is likely to sing, what it eats, behavior traits and how it constructs its nest. </p><p> All twelve birds have winter or summer ranges in the United States or Canada. This means that readers are sure to see most if not all the birds in at least one season over the year. </p><ul> <li> Red Crossbill</li> <li> Sharp-shinned Hawk </li> <li> Hermit Thrush</li> <li> Blue-gray Gnatcatcher </li> <li> Black-capped Chickadee</li> <li> Purple Finch </li> <li> Common Loon</li> <li> Barred Owl </li> <li> Red-eyed Vireo</li> <li> Wild Turkey </li> <li> White-breasted Nuthatch</li> <li> Downy Woodpecker. </li></ul> <p></p><p> Birds can be hard to spot at the best of times and never more so than in the woods. Once you learn to recognize these bird sounds, a walk through the forest will never be the same. This partner to The Little Book of Backyard Bird Songs is sure to become another family favorite. </p></p><p><p> Caz Buckingham and Andrea Pinnington are the founders of Fine Feather Press, which promotes a love of nature in children from an early age. They live near Farnham, UK. </p>I LOVE birds! Which is why I did a little happy dance when these books from Firefly Books arrived in the mail recently. I suppose that technically these are children's books (the suggested age range is 5-9), but these are truly perfect for adults like me. Gorgeous lifelike illustrations, sturdy pages, simple and interesting facts plus the buttons to push and hear actual birdsong -- I adore these field guides. (Becky Porter <i>Becky's Bookshelf</i> 2019-03-21)<br><br>"What sets The Little Book of Woodland Bird Songs apart from other beginning bird identification books is the last word in its title. The authors recognize that we often hear birds before we see them, and so the book links the auditory with the visual. Bound with this sturdy board book and encased in durable plastic is a sound module having 12 song buttons, one for each of the book's birds. Pressing the button bearing the portrait of the bird being read about activates the common sound that particular bird makes. The one-inch (3-cm) speaker actually provides excellent sound quality (and a battery is included). The Little Book of Woodland Bird Songs is an excellent home purchase, but it should certainly also be considered by libraries and classrooms that are willing to accept some wildlife sounds. Highly Recommended" (Dave Jenkinson <i>CM: Canadian Review of Materials</i> 2019-02-01)<br><br>I have used this book with babies, toddlers, and preschoolers. The babies perk up when they hear the sounds, and the toddlers and preschoolers love matching the illustration to the button to hear the sounds. This book is guaranteed to be a hit with families of bird watchers, or for those wanting to teach their children about birds. Pair this book with The Little Book of Backyard Bird Songs for more information about identifying bird sounds. (<i>Resource Links</i> 2019-04-01)<br><br>If, like me, there are kids in your orbit, there are some lovely new books that might inspire a love of birds and nature. The Little Book of Woodland Bird Songs by Andrea Pinnington and Caz Buckingham is engaging. In a board book format, it uses buttons and a little speaker to integrate birdsong with a dozen bird profiles. (Paul Nicholson <i>London Free Press</i> 2018-12-07)<br><br>These sounds are peaceful and pleasant. They are interesting and beautiful. Each bird has it's own page with facts about it and a very detailed illustration of what it looks like. These are great for toting along in the car or for finding kids "reading" by themselves.

After training his mind and body extensively, he discovers that he possesses absolutely no magical ability at all. Rather than giving up, Asta perseveres and acquires a power called "anti-magic," which may turn out to be the most effective ability of all in a world where "magic is everything." This title is the work of a relatively inexperienced author&#x2014;and it shows. Tabata has clearly taken his inspiration from popular shonen manga, and elements from series such as "Bleach," "Naruto," "Fairy Tail," and "One Piece" will be instantly recognizable to veteran manga readers. The art is solid: the characters are well-defined and expressive, the panels flow well together and are easy to follow, and the depictions of magic are whimsical. Though Tabata relies heavily on ideas from other series, there is potential here. If the series improves, it could well become the "Naruto" replacement die-hard fans have been longing for. VERDICT Though experienced readers won't find anything new here, this volume is a good introduction to shonen for manga neophytes.&#x2014;Kelley Gile, Cheshire Public Library, CT</p><h2>Neil Gaiman/Chris Riddell 3-Book Box Set: Coraline; The Graveyard Book; Fortunately, the Milk</h2><p><p><strong>This box set contains the British </strong><strong>paperback </strong><strong>editions of three bestselling Neil Gaiman classics, all illustrated by acclaimed artist Chris Riddell, to complete your collection! </strong></p><p>The editions of the Newbery Medal and Carnegie Medal winner <em>The Graveyard Book</em>; <em>Coraline</em>; and <em>Fortunately, the Milk </em>in this box set contain the illustrations from the British editions, which are both hilarious and moving.

We have tried several recipes in this book and all have been delicious. These recipes are easy, economical and delicious.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Amazon Customer</strong></p> <p>&#x201c;<strong>This book was everything I needed!</strong> It is such a struggle to try to become a great cook for 2 people when you have no idea where to start. This book open my eyes and showed me the best way to not only save money when it comes to cooking but the best way to prepare the best food possible.&#x201d; <strong>&#x2015;Apollos Griffin</strong></p> <p>&#x201c;<strong>This well-organized cookbook is now in regular rotation at my house.</strong> This is a great cookbook for anyone who cooks for two (or four, if you double recipes) and people who don&#x2019;t want to sacrifice nutrition or tastiness.&#x201d; <strong>&#x2015;Pattie Anderson</strong></p> <p>&#x201c;<strong>This is by far one of my favorite cookbooks of all time.</strong> Having a large family that is grown and moved out, it has been difficult to adjust my cooking and baking.

So grab some cake and your dancing pants and prepare for <i>Llama Destroys the World</i>... because THE TIME FOR LLAMA IS NIGH!</p></p><p><p><b>Jonathan Stutzman</b> is an award-winning independent filmmaker and writer of books for children. His short films have screened around the world and on television, and he is a contributing writer to the bestselling collection <i>The Tiny Book of Tiny Stories</i> and Emmy-winning variety show <i>HitRecord on TV. </i> When he isn&#x2019;t writing, Jonathan loves books, playing with his puppy, exploring, and watching old black and white movies. He is a staunch believer in the power of stories and the deliciousness of donuts. Jonathan lives in the wilds of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and as you read this, he is probably writing something new. </p><p><b>Heather Fox</b> is an illustrator of stories for children. Her art is filled with quirk and dashes of whimsy that is created in both doodle and digital forms. When she isn&#x2019;t creating, she is probably drinking a hot cup of coffee, eating Chinese food, or chasing down her dog (Sir Hugo) that has stolen one of her socks. Fox's books for children include <i>The Elephant's Nose</i> and <i>Llama Destroys the World</i>. She lives in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.</p>PreS-Gr 2&#x2014;On Monday, goofy, quirky Llama discovers a pile of cake, which he promptly consumes. The next day, being full of cake, he struggles to put on his dancing pants. Eventually, he wiggles into the pants, but once he starts dancing the pants rip, causing a chain reaction of mistakes that the narrator informs readers will cause the end of the world by Friday. Playful and colorful, this quasi-doom-filled story is reminiscent of the humor of Dragons Love Tacos by Adam Rubin or Unicorn Thinks He's Pretty Great by Bob Shea. The bold illustrations are a bit chaotic at times, but fitting to the story. Llama has wacky eyes and cannot say more than "I am Llama" and "dat" adding to his dopey charm. Adults will enjoy this read just as much as kids, being able to recognize the reference to "The Cha-Cha Slide" and nods to the scientific method. Full of rich vocabulary and alliteration, there is plenty of opportunity for kids to learn a thing or two from this lovable llama. Further, there is a positive message that even at seemingly the worst of times, such as the universe being sucked into a black hole, things usually work out on the other side. VERDICT A first joint effort from husband and wife team, this story will have readers chuckling again and again and coming back for more, just like Llama.&#x2014;Kaitlin Malixi, Kensington Health Sciences Academy, Philadelphia</p><h2>Rain Reign</h2><p><p><b>From Newbery Honor author Ann M.

Christensen shows how these and other products cut into the low end of the marketplace and eventually evolved to displace high-end competitors and their reigning technologies.<p> At the heart of <i>The Innovator's Dilemma</i> is how a successful company with established products keeps from being pushed aside by newer, cheaper products that will, over time, get better and become a serious threat. Christensen writes that even the best-managed companies, in spite of their attention to customers and continual investment in new technology, are susceptible to failure no matter what the industry, be it hard drives or consumer retailing.

To learn more about Lee and his work, please visit WildishIllustration.com.PreS-Gr 2&#x2014;The sweetness of this book will entice readers young and old. Reagan provides guides to basic school rules, celebrations like 100 Days and class plays, and even the bittersweet moment of moving up a grade. These are meant to put kids at ease with school situations and let them know they're not alone. As the most recent edition in the "How To..." series, this book plays to adult readers, amusing parents, while giving kids a light structure for their student experience, and reflecting gently but profoundly on the special role that teachers play in their students lives. Though the flow of the book is a bit unfamiliar&#x2014;definitely a "how to" rather than a narrative&#x2014;it is an effective method to build empathy and appreciation for the formative day-to-day work of educators.

He lives in New Jersey.PreSchool-Grade 2?A young African-American girl describes the familiar mother-daughter nightly ritual of combing the tangles out of her hair. When she cries because it hurts, her sympathetic mother tells her how lucky she is to have such beautiful hair. Imaginatively, the woman goes on to say that she can spin it into a fine, soft bun or "plant rows of braids" along her scalp, prompting her daughter to think of other wonderful things she likes about her hair. The superb watercolor illustrations move from the intimacy and security of Keyana's bedroom to the neighborhood streets and finally to the whole world as her mother's imagery becomes reflected in the art. Keyana's hair is spun on a spinning wheel, becomes part of rows of plants in a garden, and merges with a globe of the whole world. The child's favorite style, however, is two ponytails that flap like wings on each side of her head, and the final picture is of Keyana triumphantly flying free against the blue sky. Pictures and text reflect the expanding horizons of the child's world as she learns to be proud of her distinctive hair and her heritage. Carolivia Herron's Nappy Hair (Knopf, 1997) and Alexis De Veaux's The Enchanted Hair Tale (HarperCollins, 1991) treat the same subject well, but this book has a simpler text that can be used both as a read-aloud to a group or on a mother's lap.

It&#x2019;s what Bobby Riggs, a former tennis champ, said about women in 1973. But tennis player Billie Jean King stood up to this bully. With masterful skill, physical strength, and a sense of self-worth, Billie Jean would change the world with her tennis racket.<br><br> Throughout history, women have been stereotyped as weak and routinely excluded from competitions, gyms, teams, and sports clubs. With no arena in which to prove themselves fit and strong, it was hard for women to fight this sexism. Of course, this stereotype has pervaded other segments of society throughout history. Women have been denied educational, civic, business, and leadership opportunities and have had to prove they are just as smart and hardworking as men. Female athletes like Billie Jean have had to fight the most basic stereotype of all: that women&#x2019;s bodies are inherently not as strong or capable as men&#x2019;s. Their progress has been truly inspiring.<br> During the 1970s, the feminist movement was in full swing in the United States, United Kingdom, and other developed nations. Women were demanding equal pay and equal opportunities. In 1972, the United States passed Title IX as part of the Education Amendments, making it illegal for U.S. schools to discriminate in funding based on gender. For the first time, many schools began funding women&#x2019;s sports programs, and colleges began giving out women&#x2019;s sports scholarships. Finally, women could pursue their athletic passions and show the world their true strength.<br><br> The backlash was inevitable. Many still thought women should do only traditional &#x201c;ladylike&#x201d; activities. Tennis player Bobby Riggs wanted to prove that women had no place in sports by beating the best female tennis player, Billie Jean King. In 1973, he challenged her to a &#x201c;battle of the sexes&#x201d; tennis match. At first she declined. But when Bobby beat Grand Slam winner Margaret Court in the &#x201c;Mother&#x2019;s Day massacre&#x201d; game, Billie Jean understood there was more at stake than just a tennis match.&nbsp;<br><br> The whole world was watching as Billie Jean and Bobby entered the tennis court. Winning would not be enough; she would have to wipe the floor with him. And she did: 6-4, 6-3, and 6-3 for each set. Billie threw her racket into the air in victory as the crowd went wild!<br><br> Women around the world watched Billie Jean and felt empowered to stand up for themselves. Many thanked her for inspiring them to finally ask for a pay raise or&nbsp;a promotion. Men wanted their daughters to grow up strong and brave like Billie Jean. She used her sports star status as a leader off the court as well, lobbying and creating initiatives for equal opportunities in the workforce for women and people of color. This is the cultural power of sports: through entertainment and competition, they inspire courage. The fight for social justice often starts in the field or on the court. Through historic victories and setting new records, female athletes like Billie Jean shared their stories, broke down stereotypes, and created change.<br><br> Sports have always been a part of human culture, and athletes become heroes, social icons, and positive role models. Although sports should be about skill and hard work, societal prejudices often prevented women from competing. It took gutsy, fearless women to break down these barriers&#x2014;to defy the rules, be resourceful, and take dangerous risks&#x2014;all to prove their strength, independence, and ability to lead and change the world.<br><br>When the newspapers scoffed that a &#x201c;weak &#x201c;woman like Gertrude Ederle couldn&#x2019;t swim across the English Channel, Gertrude decided that she would either drown or triumph. She triumphed&#x2014;and set a new world record in 1926. When Althea Gibson, a black woman, played tennis during the segregation era, her talent was so undeniable she was able to cross the color line and become the first African American to showcase her skills at Wimbledon. The world would judge her on her skills, not her skin color, helping the civil rights movement and paving the way for athletic greats like Serena Williams. When Sue Sally Hale was told women were not allowed to play polo, she disguised herself as a man for 20 years to play the sport she loved. Sue Sally eventually leveraged her secret to force polo to become a co-ed sport, allowing her to become a leader on the field.<br><br> These are just a few examples of female athletes who proved their worth as individuals, showing the world what women can do and creating more opportunities for future generations. There are still problems in women&#x2019;s athletics, such as a lack of funding and media coverage, and unequal pay. But with each generation, women defy expectations and accomplish feats of strength that challenge the status quo. This book is filled with stories of little girls who grew up to achieve their greatest dreams&#x2014;stories of women who pushed themselves to the limit, did the impossible, and became legends.</p><h2>The Book of Secret Wisdom: The Prophetic Record of Human Destiny and Evolution (Sacred Wisdom)</h2><p><b>Buy this book now for yourself and friends at its lowest price ever!<br>Amazon may increase the price at any moment.</b><br><br>Do you wonder about the future and the destiny of humanity?<br>Do you want to know the true purpose of your existence on Earth and in the Universe?<br>A long-hidden ancient text holds the answers you seek!<br><br><b>Zinovia Dushkova</b>, <b>Ph.D.</b>, is one of the few living people who has gained access to the million-year-old manuscript widely known as the <i>Book of Dzyan</i>.

Of course he immediately wants to frolic outside, but his sleepy mother reminds him that frogs are supposed to sleep all winter. "Wake up when the snow melts," she calls out from her cozy bed. But Froggy insists. So off he goes after putting on his socks--"zoop," his boots--"zup," his hat--"zat," and his scarf--"zwit." The playful sound effects are perfect for read-aloud merriment and the watercolor illustrations by Frank Remkiewicz (<i>Horrible Harry</i>) are comic-strip silly. As soon as Froggy gets outside his mother calls out to remind him to put on his pants. This, as any child knows, means laboriously pulling off all footwear. "Zwit, zat, zup, zut." Then he forgets his coat and it's more "zut, znap, zum." And then--horror of horrors!--his mother yells out in front of all his animal playmates, "Froggy, your underwear!" (Which of course elicits giggles.) Ultimately, the on- and off-again dressing is too exhausting for Froggy and he winds up right back where he belongs. Good night, Froggy. For more adventures of Jonathan London's Froggy, explore <i>Froggy Goes to School</i>, <i>Froggy Learns to Swim</i>, and <i>Froggy's First Kiss.</i> (Ages 2 to 6) <i>--Gail Hudson</i>"My ideas for stories come from experience I've had, or from dreams or leap right out of my head - from my ever-active imagination," explains Jonathan London, who burst on the children's book scene in 1992 with the publication of three picture books. Since then he has published more than 20 picture books, including the popular&nbsp; <b>Froggy</b>&nbsp;series and the young adult novel,&nbsp; <b>Where's Home?</b> <p> "There are worlds of possibility within our own imaginations from which we can create stories that can make someone want to cry or laugh, play a saxophone or make a snowman. This act of writing, for me, is a part of my celebration of life, a way to give back a little for all that I have been given. Kind of thanks."</p> <p> Jonathan London started writing poetry in his late teens. Although he received a Masters Degree in Social Sciences and never formally studied literature or creative writing, he began to consider himself a "writer" about the time he graduated from college. After college he became a dancer in a modern dance company and worked at numerous low-paying jobs as a laborer or counselor.</p> <p> However, during this twenty-year period, London continued to write. He wrote poems and short stories for adults, earning next to nothing despite being published in many literary magazines. "It wasn't until I had kids of my own that I became a writer for children," he explains. "It all started with telling them stories when they were very young. I wrote down one of these stories, and it became&nbsp;<b>The Owl Who Became the Moon</b>, my first picture book sale (though it was my fourth to appear in print). Now I am finally making a living as a writer. A dream come true!"</p> <p> Born a "Navy brat" in Brooklyn, New York, Jonathan was raised on Naval stations throughout the U.S. and Puerto Rico. Today he lives with his wife, Maureen, and their two sons, Aaron and Sean, in rural Northern California where they like to backpack in the summer, play in the snow in winter-and dance all year around.</p> <p> Copyright (c) 2000 by Penguin Putnam Books for Young Readers.

This magical story by Amy Krouse Rosenthal (author of <i>I Wish You More</i>) illuminates Uni&#x2019;s not-so-fantastical dream and celebrates the sparkle of believing.<br><br>Uni the unicorn is told there&#x2019;s no such thing as little girls! But no matter what the grown-up unicorns say, Uni believes that little girls are REAL. Somewhere there must be a smart, strong, wonderful, magical little girl waiting to be best friends. In fact, far away (but not too far away), a real little girl believes there is a unicorn waiting for her, too. This magical story of friendship reminds believers and nonbelievers alike that sometimes wishes really can come true.</p><p>AMY KROUSE ROSENTHAL is a real girl who writes books for children (such as <i>That's Me Loving You</i>, <i>On the Spot</i>, and <i>Uni the Unicorn</i>, or course) and for grown-ups (<i>Textbook Amy Krouse Rosenthal </i>and <i>Encyclopedia of an Ordinary Life</i>).

She resides in Los Angeles with her handsome husband, cute doggy, and terrible cat. Visit Brigette at brigetteb.com.From School Library Journal <br>PreS-K&#x2014;In this delightfully entertaining story, children are transported to a land in which unicorns are the norm and little girls are believed to be mythical creatures. Uni is like all the other unicorns in so many ways. She had a swirly horn, a magnificent mane, and the magical ability to make wishes come true. "But there was one thing that definitely set Uni apart. Uni believed that little girls were REAL." Despite being laughed at and dismissed for her beliefs, she dreams of what friendship with a human girl would be like. The book features Rosenthal's familiar mix of humor and wit, making this book ideal for reading out loud or independently. Barrager's illustrations offer full page spreads of whimsical, dreamlike images that will make every reader want to believe in unicorns (or little girls). This book will be read, treasured, and loved by young dreamers.&#x2014;Megan Egbert, Meridian Library District, <br><br>Displaying a magnificent mane, golden hooves, sparkling purple eyes, and a powerful swirly horn, Uni believes that not only are little girls real but a special one will form a magical friendship with her. And somewhere, a little girl is equally certain that unicorns are real and that a very particular one is waiting to be her companion. Joyful illustrations in brilliant color capture the dreams of the two, as they spin and twirl, explore the forest, and slide down a rainbow together. Line drawings of an active youngster are set inside an outline shaped like Uni&#x2019;s head. Although usually portrayed with sweet faces, the dismay each shows when their elders tell them their thinking is only make-believe humorously reinforces their determination to find each other. And friendship triumphs as the two delightedly ride off together. Pair with Robert Heidbreder&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>I Wished for a Unicorn&nbsp;</i>(2000) and B. G. Hennessy&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Claire and the Unicorn Happy Ever After&nbsp;</i>(2010), for other happy twosomes.<br> <i>&#x2014; Lolly Gepson<br>While the spirit of Mary Blair, vintage Golden Books, and 1960s animation influences many contemporary picture books, Barrager (<i>Twelve Dancing Princesses</i>) embraces it fully in this collaboration with Rosenthal (<i>Exclamation Mark</i>). Like her fellow unicorns, Uni is magical and magnificent; she has a luxuriant magenta mane, golden hooves, and violet eyes that don&#x2019;t just sparkle&#x2014;they basically&nbsp;<i>are&nbsp;</i>sparkles. Where Uni differs from her peers is in her belief that little girls are real, that &#x201c;a strong smart wonderful magical little girl&#x201d; is out there waiting to be her best friend. In a series of single-page vignettes, Barrager shows Uni and a blonde, blue eyed human girl dashing through fields of flowers, healing forest animals with Uni&#x2019;s magical horn, and sailing past birds and clouds as they slide down a rainbow. The throwback illustration style, absence of tech (save for a nightlight and record player), and emphasis on clinging to beliefs that the world dismisses as fantasy combine to create a story that encourages kids to stay kids as long as possible.

The winner of the 1942 Caldecott Medal for THE LITTLE HOUSE, Burton's books include heroes and happy endings, lively illustrations, and a dash of nostalgia. She lived with her two sons, Aristides and Michael, and her husband George Demetrios, the sculptor, in a section of Gloucester, Massachusetts, called Folly Cove. Here she taught a class in design and from it emerged the Folly Cove designers, a group of internationally known professional artisans. She is the author of many classic children's picture books, including MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL and KATY AND THE BIG SNOW.</p>PreS-K&#x2014;Mike and his trusty steam shovel, Mary Anne, are back in this 75th anniversary edition. First published in 1939, Virginia Lee Burton's classic picture book has remained a staple in library collections for generations. Beyond the fascination almost all young children have with extra large machines that "crowd," "hoist," "swing," and "dig," the deeper tale about a man battling against the relentless march of technological change is one that still resonates more than half a century later. This new edition features a snazzy red foil dust jacket and some brief back matter that relates how Burton came up with the ending to the story (with a little creative help from a friend's grandson.) As an added bonus, a free downloadable audiobook is available, read by stage and screen actor, Matthew Broderick.

It&#x2019;s pandemonium! And it&#x2019;s definitely not as easy as A-B-C! Filled with visually humorous details, Bob Kolar&#x2019;s colorful illustrations are the perfect foil for Alethea Kontis&#x2019;s snappy story about the comic confusion that comes when the letters of the alphabet, like a class of unruly children, step out of order and show that each one has a mind of its own.</p><p>Alethea Kontis is a princess, fairy godmother and geek. She is the author of the bestselling and award-winning Books of Arilland fairy tale series. She has also dabbled in picture books, poetry, essays, online video rants and making horror movies.

He lives in Kansas City, Missouri.Grade 1-2&#x2013;Letter A starts to introduce itself and is interrupted by activist letter Z, demanding fair and equal turns at going first, wary of its last place in line, and followed in backwards order by letters Y, X, W, and (oops!) P. Soon all harmony disappears out the window, with the bickering letters and their accompanying words. Letter A remains disgruntled, and letter V insists on a second turn. Turmoil grows until letter A blossoms with not one, but a whole spread of words beginning with its sound. Digitally created googly-eyed letters with stick arms and legs, washed in bold colors, animate the alphabet with personality and emotions. Letter R performs a parody of Singing in the Rain, letter B is suspended from big beautiful balloons, letter Y knits a yarn cap, and a Sendak Wild Thing look-alike represents the letter M. Plenty of details to absorb, colorful images to grab the eye, and a confused letter template running below the action create alphabet antics for early readers.

Jeff lives with his wife and two sons in Plainville, Massachusetts, where they own a bookstore, An Unlikely Story.The main character wants to make one thing clear: this is NOT a diary--it's a journal. And it's his mother's idea for him to chronicle his life as a tortured sixth-grader, not his. One day Greg will be famous, but "for now I'm stuck in middle school with a bunch of morons." In a voice that brings to mind Holden Caulfield and David Sedaris rolled into one, Greg discusses the fleeting nature of popularity, the logic of bullying, and the fickleness of the fairer sex. Narrator Ramon de Ocampo is completely tuned in to Greg's angst-filled point of view. Though Greg is not always what you'd call a sympathetic character, de Ocampo's well-dramatized, insightful presentations of his various plights evoke our empathy--and laughter.

He was educated as a scholar of classical languages at Eton College and Cambridge University in England and later at Hebrew University, Israel. As a student, he was a philosopher and self-proclaimed agnostic.<br> While in the British Medical Corps during World War II, Prince began to study the Bible as a philosophical work. Converted through a powerful encounter with Jesus Christ, he was baptized in the Holy Spirit a few days later. This life-changing experience altered the whole course of his life, which he thereafter devoted to studying and teaching the Bible as the Word of God.<br> Internationally recognized as a Bible scholar and spiritual patriarch, Derek Prince taught and ministered on six continents for more than sixty years. Until a few years before his death at the age of 88, he traveled the world, imparting God&#x2019;s revealed truth, praying for the sick and afflicted, and sharing his prophetic insights into world events in the light of Scripture. He is the author of over eighty books, six hundred audio teachings, and one hundred video teachings, many of which have been translated and published in more than one hundred languages. He pioneered teaching on such groundbreaking themes as generational curses, the biblical significance of Israel, and demonology.<br> Derek Prince Ministries, with its international headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina, continues to distribute his teachings and to train missionaries, church leaders, and congregations through its worldwide national offices. It is estimated that Derek Prince&#x2019;s messages have reached more than half the globe through his books, CDs, and daily radio program, which is now known as<i> Derek Prince Legacy Radio</i>. In 2002 he said, &#x201c;It is my desire&#x2014;and I believe the Lord&#x2019;s desire&#x2014;that this ministry continue the work, which God began through me over sixty years ago, until Jesus returns.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>I Stink! (Kate and Jim Mcmullan)</h2><p><p><strong>Now a streaming animated series!</strong></p><p>For fans of <em>Goodnight, Goodnight, Construction Site</em> and <em>Steam Train, Dream Train</em> comes a noisy addition to the hilarious read-aloud series from Kate and Jim McMullan, the popular creators of <em>I&#x2019;m Bad!</em> and <em>I&#x2019;m Dirty! </em></p><p><em>&#x201c;Know what I do at night while you&#x2019;re asleep?

Eating your garbage and loving every stinky second of it! And you thought nighttime was just for sleeping.</p></p><p>"I stink!" How can you not love such swagger and candor? And Kate and Jim McMullan's big-eyed, loudmouthed garbage truck really <i>must</i> stink--by its own admission, and given all those smelly bags it's been cramming into its huge back hopper.<p> Most kids already love garbage trucks on general principle, and one assumes that can only go double for a sass-mouthed, animated dumper like this one, out on its early-morning rounds: "See those bags? I SMELL BREAKFAST! Crew? Get me to the curb! Lights? Blink! Brakes? Squeal! Tail gate? SAY AH!" The many opportunities for loud, large-type sound effects should make for spirited readings, and a recipe for "alphabet soup" lets young readers practice their letters, working through the ABCs from apple cores to zipped-up ziti with zucchini.</p><p> The text to <i>I Stink!</i>, while fun, is nowhere near as clever as the art. But fortunately Jim McMullan's fun, fat drawings and type treatments more than make up the difference, loading Dumpsters full of personality into this grimacing, grinning, growling--even burping!--big rig. Kids will have a good time doing diesel-powered imitations, but even more importantly, they'll learn where they'd be without their neighborhood trash truck: on top of "Mount Trash-o-rama, baby."

It is with this in mind, and from personal experience, that Zucker elected to write a book on death for this age set: two- and three-year-olds. She describes in simple terms what happens when someone dies. The author acknowledges that a book on death written just for little ones is a bit niche but emphasizes in the foreword the need to properly discuss this tough situation with young children. Proper names and pronouns within the story are written in red in order to be easily noticed and personalized when read aloud. The text is concise but heartfelt. Fleming's pencil and watercolor illustrations are done primarily in muted blues that set a melancholy tone and work well given the context. The narrative ends on a hopeful note ("Love cannot die") and is followed by tips and information about talking to kids about death. VERDICT An important book to have on hand for those who serve toddlers. It won't circulate every week, but it will come in handy when the need arises.&#x2014;Lindsay Jensen, Nashville Public Library</p><h2>Not Norman: A Goldfish Story</h2><p><b>"A sweet story that could be used as a springboard to discussion of the pitfalls of making snap judgments about pets &#x2014; or people." &#x2014; <i>School Library Journal</i></b><br><br>Norman the goldfish isn&#x2019;t what this little boy had in mind. He wanted a different kind of pet &#x2014; one that could run and catch, or chase string and climb trees, a soft furry pet to sleep on his bed at night. Definitely not Norman. But when he tries to trade Norman for a "good pet," things don&#x2019;t go as he planned. Could it be that Norman is a better pet than he thought? With wry humor and lighthearted affection, author Kelly Bennett and illustrator Noah Z. Jones tell an unexpected &#x2014; and positively fishy &#x2014; tale about finding the good in something you didn&#x2019;t know<br>you wanted.</p><p>Kelly Bennett loves fish. "Fish are fun and funny," she says. "Just watching them makes me laugh." When she's not writing, Kelly creates tile mosaics and digs in her garden. She has two grown children, Max and Lexi, and lives in Texas with her husband, Curtis, and their goldfish&#x2014;whom she would never trade.<br><br>Noah Z. Jones loves drawing fish of all shapes and sizes, but especially smallish orange ones named Norman. This is his first children's book. He lives in coastal Maine with his wife, Diane, and their tuna-lovin' cat, Mabel.K-Gr. 3. The African American boy who narrates this boy-meets-fish story wants a pet for his birthday, but not a <i>goldfish.</i> Too bad. Though he suspects that Norman is the lamest, tamest pet around, he takes his fish to school to "talk him up real good during Show-and-Tell" in hopes that someone else will want him. But after cleaning Norman's bowl, rescuing him from puppies, and noticing that Norman listens to him talk and even quiets his fear of night noises, he realizes that there is no pet he would rather have. Repeated several times during the story, the title phrase "Not Norman" takes on a new shade of meaning in the verbally clever turnaround that concludes this amusing picture book. Distilled to essential shapes and flat colors, the lively digital artwork expresses both action and emotion with flair. This eye-catching book makes a satisfying read-aloud choice for pet day or any day. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

At an early age, he received a trumpet as a gift from his father. He practiced obsessively and eventually joined a California dance band. After graduating from high school, he ventured to New York City to study art under the tutelage of Joan Sloan and Harry Wickey at the Art Students' League. He managed to support himself throughout his schooling by playing his trumpet evenings, in nightclubs and at weddings.<br><br>Gradually, he eased into making a living sketching impressions of Broadway shows for <i>The New York Times</i> and <i>The Herald Tribune</i>. This shift was helped along, in no small part, by a rather heartbreaking incident: he lost his trumpet. One evening, he was so engrossed in sketching people on the subway, he simply forgot it was sitting on the seat beside him. This new career turned out to be a near-perfect fit for Don, though, as he had always loved the theater.<br><br>He was introduced to the world of children&#x2019;s literature when William Saroyan asked him to illustrate several books. Soon after, he began to write and illustrate his own books, a career he settled into comfortably and happily. Through his writing, he was able to create his own theater: "I love the flow of turning the pages, the suspense of what's next. Ideas just come at me and after me. It's all so natural. I work all the time, long into the night, and it's such a pleasure. I don't know when the time ends. I've never been happier in my life!"<br><br>Don died in 1978, after a long and successful career. He created many beloved characters in his lifetime, perhaps the most beloved among them a stuffed, overall-wearing bear named Corduroy.<br><br>Don Freeman was the author and illustrator of many popular books for children, including <i>Corduroy</i>, <i>A Pocket for Corduroy</i>, and the Caldecott Honor Book <i>Fly High, Fly Low</i>.</p><h2>Endling #1: The Last</h2><p><p><strong>In this first book of an epic middle grade series, Katherine Applegate </strong><strong>takes us on an unforgettable journey.</strong></p><p><strong>A <em>New York Times </em>bestseller from the beloved author of</strong><strong>&nbsp;the action-packed Animorphs series and&nbsp;the award-winning <em>The</em> <em>One and Only Ivan.</em></strong></p><p>Byx is the youngest member of her dairne pack.

The story begins as the girls and boys at Grace Christian School are discussing if boys will always be boys and girls will always be girls. Their teacher explains that God gives each of us the gift of being male or female before we are born, and that you continue to be a boy or a girl whether you like to climb trees or play house, play tag or color pictures, cause a ruckus or sit quietly. </p> <p> In a world where there is so much confusion about gender and identity, pastor and best-selling author Marty Machowski shares the simple, clear truth that all of us are made in God's image as either male or female and what God made is very good! Included at the back of the book is a special section just for parents and caregivers that gives biblical guidance and help as they have this important conversation with their children. </p></p><p><p>Marty Machowski is a Family Life Pastor at Covenant Fellowship Church in Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, where he has served on the pastoral staff for over thirty years.

Marty Machowski has provided a timely resource to help you in that crucial task, his new book takes a gentle and scriptural look at what God's Word tells us about his design for the two genders. This volume offers parents a terrific way to initiate important discussions with their kids."<br><b>Jim Daly</b>, President of Focus on the Family</p> <p>"This helpful book hits all the crucial talking points in an engaging and humorous story that connects with kids (including my own).

In fact, the parents' 'cheat sheet' alone is an invaluable resource for your home."<br><b>David White</b>, Director of Discipleship at Harvest USA; pastor; author of <i>Sexual Sanity for Men </i>and <i>God, You, &amp; Sex</i></p> <p>"The message that God made boys and girls is much needed in our day.

What a tremendous resource for children!"<br><b>Mary A. Kassian</b>, Author of <i>Girls Gone Wise</i></p> <p>"In our current day, children can easily become confused about all kinds of issues that are clearly presented in the Scriptures, particularly if their home, church, and school do not provide a consistent biblical foundation. Gender issues rank high on the list of areas that children can become untethered from the Bible's teaching. This beautiful book gently teaches children to cherish their God-given gender and to love their neighbor as themselves, a timely word on a sensitive issue."<br><b>Joel R. Beeke</b>, President, Puritan Reformed Theological Seminary, Grand Rapids, Michigan</p> <p>"In a culture that is increasingly accepting of gender-fluid identities, it's so important to teach our kids that gender is part of their personhood. <i>God Made Boys and Girls</i> is a wonderful tool for that task. It reminds children (and parents!) that being a man or woman is a gift we receive from God."<br><b>Jared Kennedy</b>, Pastor of Operations and Families at Sojourn Church Midtown in Louisville, KY, Author of <i>The Beginner's Gospel Story Bible</i></p> <p>"The sin of Babel was that human beings sought to fashion society and identity on their own terms, in denial of the loving purposes and rule of our Creator God. The current cultural challenges around sex and gender are similar attempts to deny what God has given and his purposes for human flourishing. <i>God Made Boys and Girls: Helping Children Understand the Gift of Gender </i>is a timely resource to equip parents to explain God's good gift of gender to their children, and to prepare children to meet a world that is bent on denying how wonderful it is to be made in the image of God, male and female, boys and girls."<br><b>Claire Smith</b>, Author, <i>God's Good Design: What the Bible Really Says about Men and Women</i></p> <p>"Clear, careful, and unashamed, <i>God Made Boys and Girls</i> is a great tool to help children learn from their early years the truth of God's design for them, and to help both parents and children celebrate the wonder of that design.

He was 15. He didn't know what a "shooting war" meant or what he was fighting for. But he didn't want to miss out on a great adventure.<br> <br>The "shooting war" turned out to be the horror of combat and the wild luck of survival; how it feels to cross a field toward the enemy, waiting for fire. When he entered the service he was a boy. When he came back he was different; he was only 19, but he was a man with "soldier's heart," later known as "battle fatigue."</p><p>In spare, almost biblical prose, Gary Paulsen writes of the horrors of combat in a Civil War novella that puts a powerful, more contemporary spin on Stephen Crane's classic <i>The Red Badge of Courage</i>. Based on the life of a real boy, it tells the story of Charley Goddard, who lies his way into the Union Army at the age of 15. Charley has never been anyplace beyond Winona, Minnesota, and thinks war would be a great adventure. And it is--at first--as his regiment marches off through cheering crowds and pretty, flag-waving girls. But then comes the battle. Charley screams, "Make it stop now!" disbelieving that anything so horrible could be real. Paulsen is unsparing in the details of what actually happens on the battlefield: the living men suddenly blown into pieces, the agony and fear, the noise and terror, the stinking corpses. After many battles, Charley is wounded and sent home an old man before he is 20, his will to live destroyed by combat fatigue--leaving him with a "soldier's heart." Paulsen has received the Margaret A. Edwards Award, the ALAN Award, and several Newbery Honor awards for previous work, but this superb, small masterpiece transcends any of his earlier titles in its remarkable, memorable intensity and power. (Ages 12 to 15) <i>--Patty Campbell</i>Praise for <i>Soldier's Heart:</i><p><b>*</b>"Paulsen's storytelling is so psychologically true that readers will feel they have lived through Charley's experiences."<br><i>--Publishers Weekly,</i> starred</p><p>"The brevity, power, and deceptive simplicity of this novella again demonstrate why young adult readers greet Paulsen titles with unabashed enthusiasm."<br><i>--The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books</i></p><p><b>*</b>"The nightmare of the Civil War comes to the page in this novel from Paulsen...based on the real-life experiences of a young enlistee."<br><i>--Kirkus Reviews,</i> pointer</p><p><b>*</b>"The novel's spare, simple language and vivid visual images of brutality and death on the battlefield make it accessible and memorable to young people."<br><i>--Booklist,</i> starred</p></p><h2>A Middle-Earth Traveler: Sketches from Bag End to Mordor</h2><p><b><i>A Middle-earth Traveler </i>is an illustrated guide to J.R.R.

Between them they have five children, six grandchildren, and three Labradors.<b>Chapter 1</b><p>In a broad valley, at the foot of a sloping hillside, beside a clear bubbling stream, Tom was building a house. </p><p>The walls were already three feet high and rising fast. The two masons Tom had engaged were working steadily in the sunshine, their trowels going <i>scrape, slap</i> and then <i>tap, tap</i> while their laborer sweated under the weight of the big stone blocks. Tom&#x2019;s son Alfred was mixing mortar, counting aloud as he scooped sand onto a board. There was also a carpenter, working at the bench beside Tom, carefully shaping a length of beech wood with an adz. </p><p>Alfred was fourteen years old, and tall like Tom. Tom was a head higher than most men, and Alfred was only a couple of inches less, and still growing. They looked alike too: both had light-brown hair and greenish eyes with brown flecks. People said they were a handsome pair. The main difference between them was that Tom had a curly brown beard, whereas Alfred had only a fine blond fluff. The hair on Alfred&#x2019;s head had been that color once, Tom remembered fondly. Now that Alfred was becoming a man, Tom wished he would take a more intelligent interest in his work, for he had a lot to learn if he was to be a mason like his father; but so far Alfred remained bored and baffled by the principles of building. </p><p>When the house was finished it would be the most luxurious home for miles around. The ground floor would be a spacious undercroft, for storage, with a curved vault for a ceiling, so that it would not catch fire. The hall, where people actually lived, would be above, reached by an outside staircase, its height making it hard to attack and easy to defend. Against the hall wall there would be a chimney, to take away the smoke of the fire. This was a radical innovation: Tom had only ever seen one house with a chimney, but it had struck him as such a good idea that he was determined to copy it. At one end of the house, over the hall, there would be a small bedroom, for that was what earls&#x2019; daughters demanded nowadays&#x2014;they were too fine to sleep in the hall with the men and the serving wenches and the hunting dogs. The kitchen would be a separate building, for every kitchen caught fire sooner or later, and there was nothing for it but to build them far away from everything else and put up with lukewarm food. </p><p>Tom was making the doorway of the house. The doorposts would be rounded to look like columns&#x2014;a touch of distinction for the noble newlyweds who were to live here. With his eye on the shaped wooden template he was using as a guide, Tom set his iron chisel obliquely against the stone and tapped it gently with the big wooden hammer. A small shower of fragments fell away from the surface, leaving the shape a little rounder. He did it again. Smooth enough for a cathedral. </p><p>He had worked on a cathedral once&#x2014;Exeter. At first he had treated it like any other job. He had been angry and resentful when the master builder had warned him that his work was not quite up to standard: he knew himself to be rather more careful than the average mason. But then he realized that the walls of a cathedral had to be not just good, but <i>perfect</i>. This was because the cathedral was for God, and also because the building was so <i>big</i> that the slightest lean in the walls, the merest variation from the absolutely true and level, could weaken the structure fatally. Tom&#x2019;s resentment turned to fascination. The combination of a hugely ambitious building with merciless attention to the smallest detail opened Tom&#x2019;s eyes to the wonder of his craft. He learned from the Exeter master about the importance of proportion, the symbolism of various numbers, and the almost magical formulas for working out the correct width of a wall or the angle of a step in a spiral staircase. Such things captivated him. He was surprised to learn that many masons found them incomprehensible. </p><p>After a while Tom had become the master builder&#x2019;s right-hand man, and that was when he began to see the master&#x2019;s shortcomings. The man was a great craftsman and an incompetent organizer. He was completely baffled by the problems of obtaining the right quantity of stone to keep pace with the masons, making sure that the blacksmith made enough of the right tools, burning lime and carting sand for the mortar makers, felling trees for the carpenters, and getting enough money from the cathedral chapter to pay for everything. </p><p>If Tom had stayed at Exeter until the master builder died, he might have become master himself; but the chapter ran out of money&#x2014;partly because of the master&#x2019;s mismanagement&#x2014;and the craftsmen had to move on, looking for work elsewhere. Tom had been offered the post of builder to the Exeter castellan, repairing and improving the city&#x2019;s fortifications. It would have been a lifetime job, barring accidents. But Tom had turned it down, for he wanted to build another cathedral. </p><p>His wife, Agnes, had never understood that decision. They might have had a good stone house, and servants, and their own stables, and meat on the table every dinnertime; and she had never forgiven Tom for turning down the opportunity. She could not comprehend the irresistible attraction of building a cathedral: the absorbing complexity of organization, the intellectual challenge of the calculations, the sheer size of the walls, and the breathtaking beauty and grandeur of the finished building. Once he had tasted that wine, Tom was never satisfied with anything less. </p><p>That had been ten years ago. Since then they had never stayed anywhere for very long. He would design a new chapter house for a monastery, work for a year or two on a castle, or build a town house for a rich merchant; but as soon as he had some money saved he would leave, with his wife and children, and take to the road, looking for another cathedral. </p><p>He glanced up from his bench and saw Agnes standing at the edge of the building site, holding a basket of food in one hand and resting a big jug of beer on the opposite hip. It was midday. He looked at her fondly. No one would ever call her pretty, but her face was full of strength: a broad forehead, large brown eyes, a straight nose, a strong jaw. Her dark, wiry hair was parted in the middle and tied behind. She was Tom&#x2019;s soul mate. </p><p>She poured beer for Tom and Alfred. They stood there for a moment, the two big men and the strong woman, drinking beer from wooden cups; and then the fourth member of the family came skipping out of the wheat field: Martha, seven years old and as pretty as a daffodil, but a daffodil with a petal missing, for she had a gap where two milk teeth had fallen out and the new ones had not yet grown. She ran to Tom, kissed his dusty beard, and begged a sip of his bear. He hugged her bony body. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t drink too much, or you&#x2019;ll fall into a ditch,&#x201d; he said. She staggered around in a circle, pretending to be drunk. </p><p>They all sat down on the woodpile. Agnes handed Tom a hunk of wheat bread, a thick slice of boiled bacon and a small onion. He took a bite from the meat and started to peel the onion. Agnes gave the children food and began to eat her own. Perhaps it was irresponsible, Tom thought, to turn down that dull job in Exeter and go looking for a cathedral to build; but I&#x2019;ve always been able to feed them all, despite my recklessness. </p><p>He took his eating knife from the front pocket of his leather apron, cut a slice off the onion, and ate it with a bite of bread. The onion was sweet and stinging in his mouth. Agnes said: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m with child again.&#x201d; </p><p>Tom stopped chewing and stared at her. A thrill of delight took hold of him. Not knowing what to say, he just smiled foolishly at her. After a few moments she blushed, and said, &#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t <i>that</i> surprising.&#x201d; </p><p>Tom hugged her. &#x201c;Well, well,&#x201d; he said, still grinning with pleasure. &#x201c;A babe to pull my beard. And I thought the next would be Alfred&#x2019;s.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t get too happy yet,&#x201d; Agnes cautioned. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s bad luck to name the child before it&#x2019;s born.&#x201d; </p><p>Tom nodded assent. Agnes had had several miscarriages and one stillborn baby, and there had been another little girl, Matilda, who had lived on two years. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like a boy, though,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Now that Alfred&#x2019;s so big. When is it due?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;After Christmas.&#x201d; </p><p>Tom began to calculate. The shell of the house would be finished by first frost, then the stonework would have to be covered with straw to protect it through the winter. The masons would spend the cold months cutting stones for windows, vaults, doorcases and the fireplace, while the carpenter made floorboards and doors and shutters and Tom built the scaffolding for the upstairs work. Then in spring they would vault the undercroft, floor the hall above it, and put on the roof. The job would feed the family until Whitsun, by which time the baby would be a half year old. Then they would move on. &#x201c;Good,&#x201d; he said contentedly. &#x201c;This is good.&#x201d; He ate another slice of onion. </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m too old to bare children,&#x201d; said Agnes. &#x201c;This must be my last.&#x201d; </p><p>Tom thought about that. He was not sure how old she was, in numbers, but plenty of women bore children at her time in life. However, it was true they suffered more as they grew older, and the babies were not as strong. No doubt she was right. But how would she make certain that she would not conceive again? he wondered. Then he realized how, and a cloud shadowed his sunny mood. </p><p>&#x201c;I may get a good job, in a town,&#x201d; he said, trying to mollify her. &#x201c;A cathedral, or a palace. Then we might have a big house with wood floors, and a maid to help you with the baby.&#x201d; </p><p>Her face hardened, and she said skeptically: &#x201c;It may be.&#x201d; She did not like to hear talk of cathedrals. If Tom had never worked on a cathedral, her face said, she might be living in a town house now, with money saved up and buried under the fireplace, and nothing to worry about. </p><p>Tom looked away and took another bite of bacon. They had something to celebrate, but they were in disharmony. He felt let down. He chewed the tough meat for a while, then he heard a horse. He cocked his head to listen. The rider was coming through the trees from the direction of the road, taking a short cut and avoiding the village. </p><p>A moment later, a young man on a pony trotted up and dismounted. He looked like a squire, a kind of apprentice knight. &#x201c;Your lord is coming,&#x201d; he said. </p><p>Tom stood up. &#x201c;You mean Lord Percy?&#x201d; Percy Hamleigh was one of the most important men in the country. He owned this valley, and many others, and he was paying for the house. </p><p>&#x201c;His son,&#x201d; said the squire. </p><p>&#x201c;Young William.&#x201d; Percy&#x2019;s son, William, was to occupy this house after his marriage. He was engaged to Lady Aliena, the daughter of the earl of Shiring. </p><p>&#x201c;The same,&#x201d; said the squire, &#x201c;And in a rage.&#x201d; </p><p>Tom&#x2019;s heart sank. At the best of times it could be difficult to deal with the owner of a house under construction. An owner in a rage was impossible. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s he angry about?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;His bride rejected him.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;The earl&#x2019;s daughter?&#x201d; said Tom in surprise. He felt a pang of fear: he had just been thinking how secure his future was. &#x201c;I thought that was settled.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;So did we all&#x2014;except Lady Aliena, it seems,&#x201d; the squire said. &#x201c;The moment she met him, she announced that she wouldn&#x2019;t marry him for all the world and a woodcock.&#x201d; </p><p>Tom frowned worriedly. He did not want this to be true. &#x201c;But the boy&#x2019;s not bad-looking, as I recall.&#x201d; </p><p>Agnes said: &#x201c;As if that made any difference, in her position. If earls&#x2019; daughters were allowed to marry whom they please, we&#x2019;d all be ruled by strolling minstrels and dark-eyed outlaws.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;The girl may yet change her mind,&#x201d; Tom said hopefully. </p><p>&#x201c;She will if her mother takes a birch rod to her,&#x201d; Agnes said. </p><p>The squire said: &#x201c;Her mother&#x2019;s dead.&#x201d; </p><p>Agnes nodded. &#x201c;That explains why she doesn&#x2019;t know the facts of life. But I don&#x2019;t see why her father can&#x2019;t compel her.&#x201d; </p><p>The squire said: &#x201c;It seems he once promised he would never marry her to someone she hated.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;A foolish pledge!&#x201d; Tom said angrily. How could a powerful man tie himself to the whim of a girl in that way? Her marriage could affect military alliances, baronial finances... even the building of this house. </p><p>The squire said: &#x201c;She had a brother, so it&#x2019;s not <i>so</i> important whom she marries.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Even so...&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And the earl is an unbending man,&#x201d; the squire went on. &#x201c;He won&#x2019;t go back on a promise, even one made to a child.&#x201d; He shrugged. &#x201c;So they say.&#x201d; </p><p>Tom looked at the low stone walls of the house-to-be. He had not yet saved enough money to keep the family through winter, he realized with a chill. &#x201c;Perhaps the lad will find another bride to share this place with him. He&#x2019;s got the whole county to choose from.&#x201d; </p><p>Alfred spoke in a cracked adolescent voice. &#x201c;By Christ, I think this is him.&#x201d; Following his gaze, they all looked across the field. A horse was coming from the village in a gallop, kicking up a cloud of dust and earth from the pathway. Alfred&#x2019;s oath was prompted by the size as well as the speed of the horse: it was huge. Tom had seen beasts like it before, but perhaps Alfred had not. It was a war-horse, as high at the wither as a man&#x2019;s chin, and broad in proportion. Such war-horses were not bred in England, but came from overseas, and were enormously costly. </p><p>Tom dropped the remains of his bread in the pocket of his apron, then narrowed his eyes against the sun and gazed across the field. The horse had its ears back and nostrils flared, but it seemed to Tom that its head was up, a sign that it was not completely out of control. Sure enough, as it came closer the rider leaned back, hauling on the reins, and the huge animal seemed to slow a little. Now Tom could feel the drumming of its hooves in the ground beneath his feet. He looked around for Martha, thinking to pick her up and put her out of harm&#x2019;s way. Agnes had the same thought. But Martha was not to be seen. </p><p>&#x201c;In the wheat,&#x201d; Agnes said, but Tom had already figured that out and was striding across the site to the edge of the field. He scanned the waving wheat with fear in his heart but he could not see the child. </p><p>The only thing he could think of was to try and slow the horse. He stepped into the path and began to walk toward the charging beast, holding his arms wide. The horse saw him, raised its head for a better look, and slowed perceptibly. Then, to Tom&#x2019;s horror, the rider spurred it on. </p><p>&#x201c;You damned fool!&#x201d; Tom roared, although the rider could not hear. </p><p>That was when Martha stepped out of the field and into the pathway a few yards in front of Tom. </p><p>For an instant Tom stood still in a sick panic. Then he leaped forward, shouting and waving his arms; but this was a war-horse, trained to charge at yelling hordes, and it did not flinch. Martha stood in the middle of the narrow path, staring as if transfixed by the huge beast bearing down on her. There was a moment when Tom realized desperately that he could not get to her before the horse did. He swerved to one side, his arm touching the standing wheat; and at the last instant the horse swerved to the other side. The rise&#x2019;s stirrup brushed Martha&#x2019;s fine hair; a hoof stamped a hole in the ground beside her bare foot; then the horse had gone by, spraying them both with dirt, and Tom snatched her up in his arms and held her tight to his pou...</p></p><h2>Day by Day Kid&#39;s Bible (Tyndale Kids)</h2><p>Popular children's author Karyn Henley, author of <i>The Beginner's Bible,</i> has created a unique tool to help children establish Bible-reading habits for a lifetime&#x2015;with an investment of just seven minutes per day. <br><br>In this revised version of <i>God's Story,</i> daily Bible readings lead readers ages seven and up through the Scriptures in just one year. <i>The Day by Day Kid's Bible</i> bridges the gap between a Bible storybook and a full-text Bible since the Scriptures are simplified for young readers.

The question is are you training it for good or are you training it for bad. Training starts before training starts. How you live with your dog dictates how your dog lives with you. They learn from everything we do, good and bad. They miss nothing. They know us better than we know ourselves. They learn from everything we don&#39;t do. Obedience commands don&#39;t create a well behaved dog. Raising a dog and teaching along the way does. No parent says they are going outside to train their kids. We just raise them and teach them 24 hours a day and try to provide guidance so eventually our children can make the right decisions on their own. Dogs are no different. Live right with them. They are not children. They are animals and must be respected as such.

That was only about 30,000 years ago. But since then, our diets have drastically changed due to the invention of agriculture about 7,000 years ago and, within the last 100 years or so, the introduction of millions of food additives, the development of a year-round produce supply, and the hybridization of fruits and vegetables, making them higher in sugar and lower in nutrients. <i>Carnivore Cookbook</i> explores what our bodies were really designed to digest and gives compelling evidence that we were designed to be primarily meat-eaters.<br> <br> In this book, you will learn why all plants come with a downside. Antinutrients are chemicals and compounds that act as natural pesticides or defenses for the plants against being eaten. Maria explains how antinutrients can rob your body of minerals and other nutrients and lead to autoimmune issues and leaky gut. There is even a protocol for healing autoimmune issues called the Carnivore Autoimmune Protocol: a detailed system for stepping you through the various levels of carnivorous eating to find the point where your body responds best and is symptom free. You will also learn which foods are the highest in nutrient density to help your body heal.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Carnivore Cookbook</i> includes more than 100 tasty meat-focused recipes featuring innovative ways to add flavor and variety. There are even carnivore meal plans with grocery lists to make the diet easy to follow.</p><p></p><h2>Suicide Forest (World&#39;s Scariest Places)</h2><p><p><strong>From USA Today and #1 Amazon bestselling author Jeremy Bates comes a tale of mystery and horror set in Japan's ancient Suicide Forest, a place that is easy to enter but, for some, impossible to leave.

It was unlike anything that existed on earth. Part pyramid and part fortress, it squatted on the seafloor and stretched far into the distance. The structure was a gross shade of green.<b> It looked almost poisonous. </b><br> But the structure was also grand. It all but dared them to enter. <br> The figures hovered quietly before it. <b>They couldn&#x2019;t talk underwater.</b> But even if they could, the massive monument might have awed them into silence. The only sounds came from the air bubbles quietly purring, popping, and gurgling around them. <br> One of them held up a map. <br> <b>The map showed a big red X. </b><br> They all looked from the monument to the map and back again. <br> The figure with the map put it away and nodded in the direction of the structure. Colorful sea creatures drifted past. The five kicked their legs and swam deeper. <br> <b>The monument and all its many mysteries awaited. </b><br> &nbsp;<br> Harper Houston held her breath. She strained her eyes in the moonlight. <b>She knew the white-and-green-speckled eggs sitting in the sand would hatch soon.</b> And she didn&#x2019;t want to miss a moment of it. <br> Harper had seen many amazing things over the last several weeks. That&#x2019;s how long she and her friends had been using <b>special VR headsets</b> to visit a virtual world. They weren&#x2019;t playing Minecraft anymore. <b>They were living Minecraft.</b><br> <b>&nbsp;It was all so real.</b> She could feel the sand beneath her feet. She could hear the <i>snap</i> and <i>crackle</i> of her torch. And she could see cracks appearing on the sea turtle eggs they&#x2019;d found on the beach. <br> &#x201c;I wish I could take a picture of this,&#x201d; her friend Po Chen said. &#x201c;Can you say &#x2018;seashore eggshell selfie&#x2019; five times fast?&#x201d; <b>Po liked to change his appearance in the game.</b> Tonight he was dressed for the beach, with swim trunks, snorkeling gear, an inflatable float wrapped around his waist, and a shirt that only a dad would wear. <br> &#x201c;I wish I could bring a turtle home with us,&#x201d; said Jodi Mercado. <b>&#x201c;I just know they&#x2019;re going to be adorable.&#x201d;</b> Jodi was the youngest member of the group. She had a soft spot for animals. <br> <b>&#x201c;I wish they&#x2019;d hurry up and hatch,&#x201d;</b> Ash Kapoor said. &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t stay on this beach forever.&#x201d; Ash loved exploration. She wanted to see everything there was to see in this digital land. She didn&#x2019;t do a lot of standing around, either here or in the real world. <br> &#x201c;I wish you would be quiet,&#x201d; Jodi&#x2019;s older brother Morgan said, shushing them. <b>&#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t safe at night. Anything could be out there.&#x201d;</b> Morgan played more Minecraft than any of them. His knowledge frequently came in handy. And he was very serious about keeping the others safe. <br> <b>Harper smiled to herself.</b> All of her friends were wishing for something. She didn&#x2019;t have anything to wish for, though. To her, this moment was perfect just as it was. <br> <b>The eggs hatched, one after another.</b> Tiny baby sea turtles emerged to crawl along the sand. The friends all took a step back. <br> &#x201c;That way, little guys,&#x201d; Harper said, pointing to the ocean. <b>&#x201c;Go swim!&#x201d;</b> <br> Harper knew a bit about real-life sea turtles. She knew that hatchlings immediately made their way across the sand and into the ocean. She assumed Minecraft sea turtles would do the same thing. <br> &#x201c;I was right,&#x201d; said Jodi. &#x201c;They are one hundred percent adorable.&#x201d; <br> <b>&#x201c;But they sound weird,&#x201d;</b> Po added. <br> Harper strained her ears. She heard a low growl nearby. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think that sound is coming from the turtles,&#x201d; she warned. <br> Morgan hopped in alarm. <b>&#x201c;Zombies!&#x201d;</b> he cried. <br> There were four zombies in total. They appeared at the tree line where the forest met the beach. They raised their arms, groaned, and stepped onto the sand. <br> <b>&#x201c;Will they hurt the babies?&#x201d;</b> Jodi asked. She knew less than the others did about Minecraft&#x2019;s hazards. She usually just ran toward the cute mobs and away from the ones she called yucky. <br> &#x201c;No, they won&#x2019;t,&#x201d; said Ash. <b>&#x201c;Because we&#x2019;ll stop them.&#x201d;</b> <br> Harper nodded. Ash was right to be confident. As a team, they&#x2019;d been on several adventures together. <b>They had built a castle, defeated hostile mobs, and even saved a village by helping some monsters.</b> <br> And Harper had a new tool she was eager to try. She held up a bow and lined up her shot. <br> &#x201c;Nice!&#x201d; said Po. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;d you get a bow?&#x201d; <br> <b>&#x201c;I made it,&#x201d;</b> Harper answered. &#x201c;With a few sticks, and strings from a spider&#x2019;s web.&#x201d; For Harper, nothing beat the thrill of making something useful. <br> Although the thrill of defeating hordes of zombies came very close. <br> <b>She let an arrow fly. </b>It met its mark, striking a zombie right in the chest. At the same time, the rest of the group ran forward and attacked with their swords. <br> <b>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have to make bows for the rest of you,&#x201d;</b> she said. She fired another arrow. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s much nicer fighting those things from a safe distance.&#x201d; <br> <b>&#x201c;No kidding!&#x201d;</b> said Po. He dodged as a zombie swiped at him. &#x201c;Anytime you want to trade spots, just let me know.&#x201d; <br> Harper chuckled. She knew Po wasn&#x2019;t in any real danger. It would take more than a few zombies to scare her. <br> But then a <b>low moan</b> sounded at her back. It didn&#x2019;t make sense. Harper was standing on the beach. She had the ocean behind her. How could anything sneak up on her from that direction? <br> <b>She turned to see a creature rising from the surface of the water.</b> At first, she thought it was another zombie. But there was something different about it. Its skin was a sickly shade of blue. Limp strands of seaweed hung from its head. <br> <b>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a drowned!&#x201d;</b> cried Morgan. <br> &#x201c;A what?&#x201d; said Harper. She took several quick steps to distance herself from the slimy mob. <br> &#x201c;A drowned is like an underwater zombie,&#x201d; Ash shouted from across the beach. She swung her sword at one of the regular zombies. <br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not underwater at the moment,&#x201d; Harper pointed out. <br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s drawn to the baby turtles,&#x201d; Morgan said. <b>He jumped to avoid a zombie&#x2019;s grasp.</b> &#x201c;Harper, you have to stop it!&#x201d; <br> Harper saw that Morgan was right. The drowned was ignoring her and shuffling toward the turtles<b>. It would catch them before they could make it to the water.</b> <br> All of her friends had their hands full. It was up to Harper. <br> She fired an arrow at the monster&#x2019;s back. <b>Direct hit!</b> <br> The drowned flashed red. It uttered a fearsome groan and turned to face her. <br> &#x201c;Well, I got its attention,&#x201d; Harper said. It lurched toward her. <b>&#x201c;Uh-oh.&#x201d;</b> Harper lifted her bow as the creature came at her. But she was out of arrows. <br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t panic,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve still got a&#x2014;&#x201d; <br> Harper held up . . . <b>a loaf of bread</b>. <br> <b>Cooked salmon. </b><br> <b>A block of wool. </b><br> Her square eyes toggled back and forth in exasperation.<i> I really need to organize my inventory, </i>she thought. <br> The drowned was almost close enough to slash her. Leading it away from the baby turtles, she backed up all the way to the line of trees at the edge of the beach. <br> A low hissing sound came from the forest. <b>It was the sound of a creeper, about to explode.</b> <br> &#x201c;Oh no,&#x201d; Harper said. She had nowhere to run. The drowned was right in front of her, blocking her escape. She could see past it, though. She watched the baby sea turtles make it to the water. They scuttled into the ocean.<br> <b>At least she&#x2019;d been able to save them. </b><br> That was her last thought before the creeper blew up.</p><h2>The Perfect Cake: Your Ultimate Guide to Classic, Modern, and Whimsical Cakes (Perfect Baking Cookbooks)</h2><p><b>Featured by QVC, Hallmark Home &amp; Family, Tasting Table, and the Washington Post.</b><br><br>Cakes are the all-occasion dessert--the center of attention at birthdays, holiday celebrations, and dinner parties, and the most welcome brunch, after-school, or teatime snack.

If you and your child have ever encountered someone with a physical difference while out in the world, and not known quite what to say or do, consider this your easy - to - understand handbook. It's a helpful, gentle reminder that yes, we're all a little different, but at the end of the day, we're also all alike." --Gabrielle Blair, creator of "DesignMom" and founder of Alt Summit <br> <br> "I am very pleased to have a much - needed tool to offer parents and my fellow educators that will lead to interesting conversations about disabilities. I am especially excited for children with limb differences or wheelchairs or white canes who will now be able to see themselves represented in a book." --Catherine Boldt, media reviewer at "Captivating Magazine" <br> <br> "<i>When Charley Met Emma</i> brought back a flood of powerful memories of being with my mom and grandma at the park when I was a kid. I believe if we can collectively help show the world the core message of this book, we can show the world anyone is capable of having an amazing life. I'm so happy that the message in this book is getting out to people every day." --Kyle Maynard, ESPY award-winning athlete and author of <i>No Excuses</i></p><h2>The Deep: A Novel</h2><p>From the acclaimed author of <i>The Troop</i>&#x2014;a book that is &#x201c;utterly terrifying&#x201d; (Clive Barker). &#x201c;Fans of unflinching bleakness and all-out horror will love this novel....Each new shock is freshly disturbing.&#x201d; (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>, starred review)<br><br>A strange plague called the &#x2018;Gets is decimating humanity on a global scale. It causes people to forget&#x2014;small things at first, like where they left their keys, then the not-so-small things, like how to drive or the letters of the alphabet. Their bodies forget how to function involuntarily. There is no cure.<br> <br> But far below the surface of the Pacific Ocean, a universal healer hailed as &#x201c;ambrosia&#x201d; has been discovered. In order to study this phenomenon, a special research lab has been built eight miles under the sea&#x2019;s surface. But when the station goes incommunicado, a brave few descend through the lightless fathoms in hopes of unraveling the mysteries lurking at those crushing depths...and perhaps to encounter an evil blacker than anything one could possibly imagine.</p><p>Nick Cutter is a pseudonym for an acclaimed author of novels and short stories. He lives in Toronto, Canada.Deep 1.<p></p> <br>THE OLD MAN&#x2019;S HEAD was covered in mantises.<br> <br>At first Luke thought it was a wig or some weird toupee&#x2014;but he was at the southern tip of Guam, a few miles from the Pacific, and the man was wearing tattered clothes and what looked like strips of old radial tires lashed to his feet. Why bother with a toupee?<br> <br>The driver saw the old man, too. He hissed between his teeth&#x2014;an uneasy tssshk! He said something under his breath: a curse, maybe a prayer? Luke didn&#x2019;t speak the local dialect.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do it,&#x201d; Luke told the driver. &#x201c;You wait here.&#x201d;<br> <br>He elbowed the Jeep&#x2019;s door open. Sweet Jesus, the heat. It&#x2019;d hit him like a fist when he stepped onto the runway at the Agana airport. It hit him again now&#x2014;the tropical air, laden with the nectar of heliotropes, caused beads of sweat to pop along his brow.<br> <br>The old man stood facing the wall of a one-story workshop. The ground was strewn with hubcaps and crankcases snarled in rusted wiring. Wrist-thick vines snaked out of the greenery to twine around the industrial junk; with nobody around to hack it back, the jungle would reclaim this spot in a matter of months.<br> <br>The old man was walking into the wall&#x2014;his sandals made a gentle whush-whush as they brushed the yellowing adobe. The spotting was pronounced on his bare arms and his throat. The scabs were dime-sized, bigger than what Luke was used to seeing. Some of them had cracked open and were leaking grayish pus.<br> <br>Luke had no clue what had drawn the mantises. Maybe they&#x2019;d dropped from the creeping ivy snarled across the shop&#x2019;s roof. Or maybe something on the man&#x2019;s scalp, or leaching out of it, had attracted them.<br> <br>They were the largest insects Luke had ever seen. Each mantis was the length of his thumb, and muscular-looking. They had swollen, cantilevered abdomens that curved above their sharp, considering faces. A baker&#x2019;s dozen or so carpeted the man&#x2019;s skull.<br> <br>Luke got the sense of them turning to stare at him, all at once.<br> <br>Luke retreated to the ditch. His feet sank into the muck. He didn&#x2019;t like the way it sucked at his boots&#x2014;greedy, a lipless brown mouth.<br> <br>He found a stick and went back. The insects squirmed quarrelsomely on the man&#x2019;s head, which was covered with wispy white hairs as downy as those on a baby&#x2019;s skull. Their exoskeletons made a brittle chitter. What the hell were they doing?<br> <br>Luke watched their choreographed manner. The stink of burned diesel mixed with the heliotropes to create a sticky vapor that coated his throat. Distantly, he heard the driver repeat what he&#x2019;d said before&#x2014;that breathless curse or prayer&#x2014;and Luke was worried he&#x2019;d set the Jeep in gear and take off, leaving him with the old man and the mantises, the heat and the crawling jungle.<br> <br>What in God&#x2019;s name were those bugs doing?<br> <br>One mantis pinned another in a violent vise grip, then widened its jaws and bit down, cleaving the other&#x2019;s head in half. Their abdomens were wed. What was clearly the female continued to eat the male&#x2019;s head while his antenna whipped about frantically.<br> <br>Using the stick, Luke brushed the mantises off the man&#x2019;s skull. A decapitated male skittered wildly across Luke&#x2019;s fingers; he shook it into the mud with the rest of them. The urge arose to step on them. Squash them all to paste.<br> <br>Instead, Luke set his hands on the old man&#x2019;s shoulders to turn him around. His expression was familiar: The Big Blank. His eyes gone milky, the edges of his eyelids pebbled with nodules of acne that gave his skin the look of an orange rind. His mouth wide open, his tongue coated in white film. He may not have drunk water in days. He&#x2019;d forgotten to, probably.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s how it went with the &#x2019;Gets: you forgot the little things first, then the not-so-little things, then the big ones. Next, the critical ones. In time, your heart forgot how to beat, your lungs how to breathe. You die knowing nothing at all.<br> <br>As soon as Luke pointed him in a new direction, the old man started to walk. He&#x2019;d go on until he fell down or stepped off a cliff or stumbled into a leopard&#x2019;s den, if they had those around here. And Luke couldn&#x2019;t do a damn thing about that.<br> <br>He climbed back into the Jeep. The driver eased past the old man as he tottered down the road, that clingy mud sucking up past his ankles already. Luke watched as they pulled away, the old man&#x2019;s body becoming indistinct through the stinging fumes.</p><h2>Lots of Feelings (Shelley Rotner&#39;s Early Childhood Library)</h2><p><p>You can read a book, but did you know that you can also read a face?

From grumpy squints, excited grins, and surprised shouts, the photos move to whimsical curiosity, sadness (complete with tears), and sleepy yawns. Most pages clearly capture the precise quality they attempt to portray, particularly the twisted mouth of "confused" and the classic pout of "grumpy." Others are more subtle, such as "thoughtful" and "proud," or "frightened." This collection provides youngsters with the necessary labels to discuss their feelings.

Kudos to a pint-size Poirot, pre-Mustache!" -<i> Booklist</i><br><br>"Barnett's signature dry wit and snappy back-and-forths, particularly between the ingenuously sincere Mac and the standoffish Queen, keep the story steadily moving forward; a convoluted historical account of Colonel Blood's attempted robbery...Lowery's cartoony spot art, in black, green, and orange, provides additional historical and cultural information and frequently supports the narrative." - <i>Horn Book</i><br><br>"Barnett and Lowery team up again in this second outing of international espionage mystery with royal overtones... this is a nifty mystery for young readers and a worthy sequel to the first." - <i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><b>Praise for <i>Mac Undercover</i> (Mac B., Kid Spy #1):</b><br><br><b>A <i>New York Times</i> bestseller!</b><br><br><b>An Amazon Best Book of 2018</b><br><br>* "Barnett and Lowery bring the funny to the serious art of espionage in a perfect interplay of text and illustration...Barnett interweaves tidbits of global history fit for trivia lovers, while Lowery's comic-style images play a key role in the humor...Told with a sense of nostalgia for 1980s history and pop culture, the silliness and originality of this book will hook young readers." -- <i>School Library Journal</i>, starred review<br><br>"Barnett takes his readers on a fun-filled ride...Barnett's tone throughout the story is humorous, lighthearted, and a little glib, and the over-the-top story is sure to appeal to many readers...an enjoyable romp that will leave readers salivating for the sequel." -- <i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br>"[Barnett's] riotous series debut as an adult recalling a 1980s childhood caper...goofy, two-color pictures by Lowery (the Doodle Adventure series) ramp up the silliness of this adventure...which should snare even the most hesitant readers." --<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>"Barnett's knack for both quirky situational humor and heartfelt sentiment work in tandem to create a balanced-while still outrageous-early-chapter-book caper.

If not now, when?</p><p>--Rabbi Hillel</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One of the most important experiences of my life happened when I was six years old. My family lived in Illinois, on the edge of cornfields. I remember standing outside early one evening, looking down at the rainwater in the ruts left by tractors, and then looking back at our house. I felt wistful and sad about the anger inside it. There were lights twinkling in the distant hills, the homes of other, perhaps happier families.</p><p>As an adult today, I can see that my parents were loving, decent people dealing with their own stresses, and that my childhood was fortunate in many ways. My dad had a tough job and my mom had her hands full with my sister and me. I don&#x2019;t remember what happened in our home that night. It could have been an ordinary argument. But as if it were yesterday, I remember feeling a caring toward myself. I felt bad, those feelings mattered, and I wanted to help myself feel better. Many years later, I learned that this was compassion--the recognition of pain with the desire to relieve it--which can be given to oneself much as it can be given to others.</p><p>I clearly recall knowing that it would be up to me to get through the time ahead, and to find those lights and those people and that greater happiness. I loved my parents and wasn&#x2019;t against anyone. But I was for myself. I was determined--as a child can be, and an adult as well--to have as good a life as I could.</p><p>My own path of well-being began with compassion, as it does for most people. Compassion for yourself is fundamental, since if you don&#x2019;t care how you feel and want to do something about it, it&#x2019;s hard to make an effort to become happier and more resilient. Compassion is both soft and muscular. For example, studies show that when people feel compassion, motor planning areas in the brain begin preparing for action.</p><p>Compassion is a psychological resource, an inner strength. In this chapter, we&#x2019;ll explore how to grow compassion and use it for yourself, and in later chapters, we&#x2019;ll see how to bring compassion to others.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Be for Yourself</p><p>When we treat others with respect and caring, the best in them usually comes out. Much the same would happen if we could treat ourselves the same way.</p><p>Yet most of us are a better friend to others than we are to ourselves. We care about their pain, see positive qualities in them, and treat them fairly and kindly. But what kind of friend are you to yourself? Many people are tough on themselves, critical, second-guessing and self-doubting, tearing down rather than building up.</p><p>Imagine treating yourself like you would a friend. You&#x2019;d be encouraging, warm, and sympathetic, and you&#x2019;d help yourself heal and grow. Think about what a typical day would be like if you were on your own side. What would it feel like to appreciate your good intentions and good heart, and be less self-critical?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Why It&#x2019;s Good to Be Good to Yourself</p><p>It helps to understand the reasons it&#x2019;s both fair and important to be on your own side. Otherwise, beliefs like these can take over: &#x201c;It&#x2019;s selfish to think about what you want.&#x201d; &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t deserve love.&#x201d; &#x201c;Deep down you&#x2019;re bad.&#x201d; &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll fail if you dream bigger dreams.&#x201d;</p><p>First, there&#x2019;s the general principle that we should treat people with decency and compassion. Well, &#x201c;people&#x201d; includes the person who wears your name tag. The Golden Rule is a two-way street: we should do unto ourselves as we do unto others.</p><p>Second, the more influence we have over someone, the more responsibility we have to treat them well. For example, surgeons have great power over their patients, so they have a great duty to be careful when they operate on them. Who&#x2019;s the one person you can affect the most? It&#x2019;s yourself, both you in this moment and your future self: the person you will be in the next minute, week, or year. If you think of yourself as someone to whom you have a duty of care and kindness, what might change in how you talk to yourself, and in how you go about your day?</p><p>Third, being good to yourself is good for others. When people increase their own well-being, they usually become more patient, cooperative, and caring in their relationships. Think about how it would benefit others if you felt less stressed, worried, or irritated, and more peaceful, contented, and loving.</p><p>You can take practical steps to help yourself really believe that it&#x2019;s good to treat yourself with respect and compassion. You could write down simple statements--such as &#x201c;I am on my own side&#x201d; or &#x201c;I&#x2019;m taking a stand for myself&#x201d; or &#x201c;I matter, too&#x201d;--and read them aloud to yourself or put them somewhere you&#x2019;ll see each day. You could imagine telling someone why you are going to take better care of your own needs. Or imagine a friend, a mentor, or even your fairy godmother telling you to be on your own side--and let them talk you into it!</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The Feeling of Caring for Yourself</p><p>When I left home for UCLA in 1969, I was hyper-rational and stuck in my head. This was a way to avoid feeling sad, hurt, and worried, but then I didn&#x2019;t feel much of anything at all. I had to get in touch with myself in order to heal and grow. California in the 1970s was at the center of the human potential movement, and I dove in even though it seemed kind of freaky. (Primal screaming! Encounter groups! Bare your soul on demand!) I gradually learned to tune into my emotions and body sensations in general. In particular, I started paying attention to what it felt like to get on my own side, and to have warmth and support toward myself instead of coldness and criticism. It felt good to do this, so I kept doing it. Each time I focused on these positive experiences was like working a muscle and strengthening it, again and again. With repetition, kindness and encouragement for myself gradually sank in and became a natural way of being.</p><p>Many years later as a psychologist, I learned how my intuitive efforts had worked. Focusing on and staying with any experience of a psychological resource--such as the sense of being for yourself--is a powerful way to reinforce it in your brain. Then you take that inner strength with you wherever you go.</p><p>In the chapters on Mindfulness and Learning, I&#x2019;ll explain in detail how to turn your thoughts and feelings into lasting strengths inside: the basis of true resilience. The essence is simple: first, experience what you want to develop in yourself--such as compassion or gratitude--and second, focus on it and keep it going to increase its consolidation in your nervous system.</p><p>This is the fundamental process of positive brain change. To get a sense of it, try the practice in the box. It takes only a minute or two, or you can slow it down for a deeper effect. Like anything I suggest, adapt it to your own needs. Additionally, in the flow of everyday life, notice when you have an attitude or feeling of caring for yourself, and then stay with the experience for a few extra moments, feeling it in your body, sinking into it as it sinks into you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Being for Yourself</p><p>Bring to mind a time when you were on somebody&#x2019;s side: perhaps a child you were protecting, a friend you were encouraging, or an aging parent with health issues. Recall what this felt like in your body--in the set of your shoulders, in the expression on your face. Recall some of your thoughts and feelings--perhaps caring, determination, even a fierce intensity.</p><p>Then, knowing what it&#x2019;s like to be on someone&#x2019;s side, apply this attitude to yourself. Get a sense of being an ally to yourself--someone who will look out for you, help you, protect you. Recognize that you have rights and needs that matter.</p><p>It&#x2019;s normal if other reactions come up, such as feeling unworthy. Just notice and disengage from them, and then come back to the sense of wishing yourself well. Focus on this experience, and stay with it for a couple breaths or longer.</p><p>Bring to mind times when you were really on your own side. Perhaps you were encouraging yourself during a tough period at work or speaking up to someone who hurt you. Get a sense of what that was like, emotionally and in your body. Remember some of the thoughts you had, such as &#x201c;It&#x2019;s only fair for others to help, too.&#x201d; Stay with this experience and let it fill your mind.</p><p>Know what it&#x2019;s like to be committed to your own well-being. Let the feelings, thoughts, and intentions of being a true friend to yourself sink in, becoming a part of you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bring Compassion to Your Pain</p><p>Compassion is a warmhearted sensitivity to suffering--from subtle mental or physical discomfort to agonizing pain--along with the desire to help if you can. Giving compassion lowers stress and calms your body. Receiving compassion makes you stronger: more able to take a breath, find your footing, and keep on going.</p><p>You get the benefits of both giving and receiving compassion when you offer it to yourself. Much as you can see the burdens and stresses of others, you can recognize these same things in yourself. Much as you can feel moved by their suffering, you can be touched by your own. You can bring the same support to yourself that you&#x2019;d provide for someone else. And if there&#x2019;s not much compassion for you coming from others, it&#x2019;s more important than ever to give it to yourself.</p><p>This is not whining or wallowing in misery. Compassion for yourself is where you start when things are tough, not where you stop. Research by Kristin Neff and others has shown that self-compassion makes a person more resilient, more able to bounce back. It lowers self-criticism and builds up self-worth, helping you to be more ambitious and successful, not complacent and lazy. In compassion for your own pain is a sense of common humanity: we all suffer, we all face disease and death, we all lose others we love. Everyone is fragile. As Leonard Cohen sang: &#x201c;There is a crack in everything / That&#x2019;s how the light gets in.&#x201d; Everyone is cracked. Everyone needs compassion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Challenges to Self-Compassion</p><p>Yet self-compassion is challenging for many of us. One reason has to do with how our nervous system works. The brain is designed to be changed by our experiences, particularly negative ones, and especially those that occurred in childhood. It&#x2019;s normal to internalize the ways that your parents and others have treated you--which might have included ignoring, belittling, or punishing your softer feelings and longings--and then treat yourself in the same way.</p><p>For example, I had conscientious and loving parents, and I&#x2019;m very grateful to them. That said, while growing up, I experienced frequent criticism and not much compassion, and I took these attitudes into myself. I&#x2019;ve always been moved by the pain of others. But my own pain? I pushed it away, and then wondered why it kept growing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Learning Compassion</p><p>I had to learn how to bring compassion to my own suffering. We learn many things in life, including how to ride a bicycle, apologize to a friend, or talk ourselves down from being upset. What does it take for learning to happen?</p><p>The key to growing any psychological resource, including compassion, is to have repeated experiences of it that get turned into lasting changes in neural structure or function. It&#x2019;s like recording a song on an old-fashioned tape recorder: as the song plays--as you experience the resource--you can help it leave a physical trace behind in your nervous system.</p><p>When you&#x2019;re already experiencing something enjoyable or useful--perhaps the satisfaction in finishing a report at work or the comfort in plopping onto the sofa at the end of a long day--simply notice it. You can also deliberately create an experience of something you want to develop, such as the feeling of being on your own side. Once you&#x2019;re having the experience, feel it as fully as possible and take a little time--a breath or two or ten--to stay with it. The more often you do this, the more you will tend to hardwire psychological resources into yourself.</p><p>To develop more self-compassion, take a few minutes to try the practice in the box. As you build up compassion for yourself, you&#x2019;ll be more able to tap into it whenever you want.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Compassion for Yourself</p><p>Bring to mind times you have felt cared about by people, pets, or spiritual beings, in your life today or in your past. Any kind of caring for you counts, such as times you were included, seen, appreciated, liked, or loved. Relax and open yourself to feeling cared about. If you get distracted, just come back to feeling cared about. Stay with these feelings and sense them sinking in, like water into a sponge.</p><p>Then think about one or more people you have compassion for--perhaps a child in pain, a friend going through a divorce, or refugees on the other side of the world. Get a sense of their burdens, worries, and suffering. Feel a warmheartedness, a sympathetic concern. You could put a hand on your heart and have thoughts such as, &#x201c;May your pain ease . . . may you find work . . . may you get through this illness.&#x201d; Give yourself over to compassion, letting it fill you and flow through you.</p><p>Knowing what compassion feels like, apply it to yourself. Recognize any ways you feel stressed, tired, ill, mistreated, or unhappy. Then bring compassion to yourself as you would to a friend who felt like you do. Know that everyone suffers and that you are not alone in your pain. Perhaps place a hand on your heart or your cheek. Depending on what has happened, you could think, &#x201c;May I not suffer . . . may these hurt feelings pass . . . may I not worry so much . . . may I heal from this illness.&#x201d; Imagine compassion like a gentle warm rain coming down into you, touching and soothing the weary, hurting, longing places inside.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Find Acceptance</p><p>One time a friend and I climbed the East Buttress to the top of Mount Whitney. The route back to our tent went down a snow-filled gulley. It was October, the snow had turned to ice, and we had to move carefully and slowly. It was getting dark and we couldn&#x2019;t see where we were going. Rather than risk a deadly fall, we decided to sit on a small ledge all night, wrapped in a space blanket with our feet in our daypacks, shivering in freezing temperatures.</p></p><h2>Whose Hat Is This?: A Look at Hats Workers Wear - Hard, Tall, and Shiny (Whose Is It?: Community Workers)</h2><p>Put on your thinking cap and guess whose hat is whose.
